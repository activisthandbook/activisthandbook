[Tipping Point UK](https://tippingpointuk.org/) is a UK-based non-profit organization that focuses on supporting grassroots climate justice groups. Founded by a team of experienced activists with over 40 years of combined experience in the movement, Tipping Point has been at the forefront of the UK fossil fuel divestment movement and has played a key role in organizing some of the largest grassroots mobilizations, actions, and climate campaigns of the last decade.

Tipping Point's approach involves building networks of grassroots groups to increase their scale, diversity, and power, providing training and resources to help groups take bold and sustained action, and harnessing momentum through strategic campaigns to increase support for climate justice solutions. The organization offers a range of services, including a tech hub, training programs, a network hub, and support for groups organizing climate actions.
