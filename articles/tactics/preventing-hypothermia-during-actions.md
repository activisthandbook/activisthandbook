Preventing hypothermia during action:

-   Remember and remind others to eat, drink, and sleep enough.
    
-   Prioritise yourself - you cannot help others while hypothermic yourself.
    
-   Layer properly - tight-fitting wool or moisture wicking first layer, insulating layers, water/windproof top layer.
    
-   Clothing - hat, scarf, gloves, hoodies, warm/thick socks, strong/warm shoes - avoid cotton.
    
-   Physical activity, if possible.
    

###   
Warming up during an occupation:

Ask supporters to bring hot drinks, food, or hot water for hot water bottles, use hand warmers, cuddle with someone, put on another layer of clothes, pull a blanket over yourself if you have spares, get into a sleeping bag if you aren’t already.  
Stay dry - avoid cotton, have waterproof layers on top of your clothes, if your inner layers get wet try to change them to dry clothes as soon as possible (if needed, ask a supporter to bring or buy).

###   
  
Signs of hypothermia:

-   Feeling cold and shivering - do not try to “be tough”, tell people if you are cold and do whatever you can to warm up.
    
-   _“the umbles”:_  
    Stumbles (loss of control over/slow movement, stiffness in hands/feet)  
    Mumbles (slurred/slowed/incoherent speech, sleepiness, confusion)  
    Fumbles (slow reaction time, dropping objects, poor coordination)  
    Grumbles (change in behaviour, typically apathy and negativity)
    
-   Previous symptoms may worsen - your action should have a plan for what to do if someone gets hypothermia, this is when you begin to enact this. This may include the person leaving the action if possible to go inside somewhere and warm up.
    
-   Stopping shivering, muscle rigidity, unresponsiveness, slow breathing, slow pulse - if it gets to this point, it is a medical emergency requiring professionals. Your life is more important than continuing to participate in the action.
