## About this strategy

Most conventional activists, especially those visible in the mainstream, are using what we called _**Institutional**_ strategies - putting pressure on governments to tweak the current system in order to improve the wellbeing of the people they represent. Some of the strategies from this category are Calling to vote, lawsuits, lobbying, advocacy campaigns, running for office, talking to politicians… What’s common for all of these is that their primary target are people in institutions of power (companies, national, regional or local governments, public institutions etc), and the demands are changes within the framework of the current system.
