A Complete Guide to Wheatpasting

## Preparation

### Designs and Format

Generally, anything printed makes for the best wheatpaste product, spongy printer paper - even if it seems a little glossy is perfect at absorbing glue and water.

Try to print things by yourself when you can; libraries, colleges, corner stores, anywhere you can get a good feel on the paper you’re using. If ordering  
printed posters make sure to choose paper that’s on the thinner side, and uncoated if possible.

Avoid gloss flyers, or anything with added finish as it probably won’t stick. Normal paper has a GSM of 80-100, and anything over that is probably too thick to melt flush against the surface you’ll paste on (think business cards for example).  
In terms of format, there’s no set rules on exactly how big or small your project should be; huge wheatpaste projects can be done! But they need the right equipment (see further) to make it happen, and the larger your paper size the longer it’ll take to put up. Best sizes to stick to for fast radical graff are  
A4, or A5, maybe even just half an A4 sheet can do well too if you’re going for a repetitive fly posting block! Bigger posters = more stuff, so keep that in mind when choosing what to work with.

### Making Wheatpaste

Wheatpaste is a relatively simple thing to make, but it can also be bought in hardware stores - sometimes labelled as wallpaper glue or decorating paste - and is the sticky solid base of applying anything soft and malleable. Wheatpaste can be made and stored for a few days before action, but generally I wouldn’t make it more than a week in advance so try to use it fast!

Depending on how you make it, it’ll either solidify or rot if not used in time.

  
**_The recipe:_**  
1\. 2 parts flour, to 3 parts water. If you use 2 cups of flour, use 3 of water, or any measurement. Go nuts.  
2\. Stir in a pan over a low heat until combined, bringing to a simmer where it should thicken, while stirring continuously - do not let it burn!  
\- OPTIONAL - Some people use glue or sugar/starch to make it stickier, but this does bring down its shelf life.  
3\. When it thickens turn down the heat and add more water until you’re happy with the consistency.  
\- When you’re actually using the paste you want it to be easily spreadable, nice and thin like a sauce so it won’t change the colour of your posters, and if you get it to this consistency in the cooking stage it can be used straight away, which might be what you want! ALTHOUGH a very helpful strategy is to make it really thick, to the point where it sticks to itself and to use it like a wheatpaste base that you can add water to and make more with on the day (which reduces a lot of space and weight).

1.  Allow to cool and move to your desired container and put in the fridge for best preservation.
    
2.  Your paste is ready.  
    \- NOTE ON CONTAINERS - if you’ve got thin paste, some people recommend putting it into a bottle you can squeeze onto a wall or brush, or something like a small bucket or a screw top container works too.
    
    Please be careful if you’re putting a lot of watery paste in a shallow long tub, long term storage of it is high risk for leaks.
    
    ### Equipment
    
    Here’s your action equipment, some are suggestions, others glaringly obvious necessities:  
    \- Paintbrushes - you’re gonna need a huge brush to apply the paste onto your surfaces fast, and to fully cover those posters after. Seriously, big brush. You can also take a smaller one for mixing paste together if you’re doing the dilution method from section b.
    
    \- Foil/bags - in between pasting, or when travelling, keep your messy brushes and equipment within one specific bag, or encased in foil. Wheatpaste is sticky, slimy, and dries like crust. Keep it contained.  
    \- Gloves - for yourself if you feel you need them, but they’re also a great place for storing brushes again!  
    \- Towel/rag - to wipe things off; surfaces, yourself, your equipment, to make a workstation.  
    \- Water - in case your paste gets thick, or you get thirsty, or you need to wash wheatpaste off.
    

## Action

### Teamwork

Wheatpaste projects work better as a team. Assigning roles and working out exactly who’s going to have what kit can make things easier, and help you move as a group more effectively. Having someone on dedicated paste-brush duty, someone pulling the posters out and slapping them up, and maybe someone else to take photos if that’s what you’re looking for.

Make sure that a single person is handling a single step of the process to maximise time. Communication is key, be clear when you’re claiming spots, when you’ve finished prepping the area and if you’ve thoroughly covered your poster yet or not.

### Technique

Here’s your practical wheatpasting formula. You and your gang see a spot, walk up to it, and someone applies a first coat of paste, about the same width and height as your poster.

Next person sticks it up, and then the first person can go back and paste over it again, securing it. Or, if you’re doing a lot at once, it could be helpful to have someone specifically doing the top coats.

After that, snap a photo if you want and dash away from the scene. Simple. Get in, get out, never be noticed.

####   
Confidence

Don’t be nervous, you’ll get into the swing of things eventually but if you’re  
worried about drawing attention try not to be too jumpy. A lot of the time people just don’t notice what’s going on around them, and probably don’t care anyway (if they can even tell what you’re doing).  
Keep a clear planned route, and know how many you’ve got left at all times.

####   
Targets

Some surfaces are better than others. Brick, and stone is a no go. Plywood or MDF is holy grail for sticking. Signs and bus stops work too, and anything smooth should work. metal, glass, plastic. Think bins, electric boxes, doors, notice boards.

The wheatpaste builds a solid base on most surfaces to keep  
it sticky, so don’t worry about it slipping off like water. Avoid anything bumpy or extremely curved as it can warp your design, and things that area heavily wet could also disturb your process.

###   
Tactical tips

Blending in is key. Everything needs to be easy and quick to reach, while also not absolutely screaming 'Hey I’m gonna stick posters everywhere.’ So, try to disguise your equipment.

Carrying your posters in a gift bag is a smart play, the opening at the top gives ease of access and it can also help protect them from the elements, flying away or getting bent and torn. If you’re up for a birthday party, try getting everyone  
to carry their stuff in inconspicuous containers.  
If pasting at night, high-risk spots or in a busy area, absolutely cover your face, go the whole nine yards and make sure you’re unrecognisable. But during the day, skulking around a town with an activist getup while carrying tools can draw even more unwanted attention. Feel it out; adjust your precautions as necessary for environment, but always keep a standard of some sort — never  
go in unprotected.

###   
Cleanup

Now you’re done, it’s important to tidy up any loose ends of the action, ensure everyone gets their stuff back and wash out your containers. Physical cleaning of things like brushes and buckets can wait a little while, so put it at the bottom of your list. Make sure you’re clean, fed and happy before taking on any of  
that stuff.

If you’re in a disguise of some sort make sure you’re sufficiently far away and out of direct view when you take it off. Try to conceal any items that could give away what you were doing especially.

Having waterproof bags to put your brushes and messy gear into will really help here, and can minimise mess that comes with all the loose equipment.

If kept somewhat airtight or wet/enclosed the paste shouldn’t dry on your brushes, so don’t worry. Just make sure you can wash them off and clean any boxes before it goes rotten or rusts the metal on your brushes

### Journalling

If you want evidence of your postering, you can take pictures as you go, and use them for any journalistic mediums you wish. If you’re going to do minimal editing on your photos, make sure to clear any metadata, or opt for something externally edited, on a computer or separate program from your phone’s camera. This minimises risks of doxxing and potential legal action being taken against you.

Of course, make sure to follow personal security protocols and don’t take a bare face selfie with your work. Avoid exposing people’s specific roles in photos either, or making it obvious who took it.

Wheatpasting is illegal, so don't get caught.
