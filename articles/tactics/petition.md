In this article, we investigate whether petitions work. We also provide some suggestions to increase the potential of petitions as a campaigning tactic.

## Introduction

Activists can use petitions to grow their movements by gathering signatures from people who support their cause. Petitions can also be used to pressure lawmakers and other decision-makers to take action on an issue. Additionally, petitions can help activists build a database of supporters who can be mobilized for future actions.

## Do petitions work?

The short answer: we do not know. The majority of articles out there on the internet discuss the use of petitions quite uncritically. We do not want to go straight to explaining how to create a petition, without first seriously discussing the possibility that it might actually be a counterproductive tactic.

To find out if petitions work, we have formulated some hypotheses. In the spirit of collaborative research, we encourage you to add arguments and data to prove or disprove these hypotheses.

> **What is an hypothesis?** An hypothesis is nothing more than a theory. It could be true or false. You should look at data and arguments to find out which is the case.

### Context

#### Missing expertise

Organisations may not have the ability to collect and analyse the data required to find out if their petitions are effective.

#### Conflicting interests

Even if an organisation has the _ability_ to make data-driven decisions, there may not be the _motivation_ to do so. Organisations often have a conflicting interest of proving their tactics are effective, regardless of whether they actually are. For example:

-   **Donors** are more likely to donate to successful organisations, so it is financially advantageous to portray yourself more impactful than you actually are.
    
-   We might want to tell a **positive story**, because we are afraid that telling a negative story that reflects critically on yourself and others can demotivate people to act at all. If you are working tirelessly for your cause, you likely want to hear it has not all been for nothing.
    
-   **Not knowing what to do is uncomfortable**. It can be more comfortable to continue confidently on the chosen path, instead of acknowledging you have no idea what you are doing. The same goes for acknowledging mistakes.
    
-   We might not like to hear about more **effective alternatives**. Alternatives may involve more time, energy and risk required. We like to think that all it takes to change the world is filling out an online form from the safety of your comfortable sofa, even if more is needed.
    
-   It might be in the interest of the **fundraising** team to continue using petitions, because it can be a useful tactic for getting donations. The financial dependency on donors, and thus indirectly also lead-generating methods such as petitions, may make it attractive to portray petitions as more than a money-maker (and pretend it is also useful to make political impact).
    

### Hypothesis 1: Petitions do not cause policy changes

#### Explanation

According to this hypothesis, petitions on their own are **not** an effective tactic to cause meaningful policy changes, even with large numbers of signatures.

In this hypothesis, we specifically focus on the use of petitions without combining them with other tactics, such as using the collected contact details for another purpose.

#### Testing the hypothesis

Find out if there is a **correlation** between petitions happening and policy changes occurring afterwards. Since correlation is not the same as causation, we need to do some further research:

-   If there is a **consistent** **positive** **correlation**, find out if any other factors might be able to explain this correlation. For example, activists may have been using other tactics at the same time.
    
-   If there is an **inconsistent positive correlation**, find out what factors were only present in the cases of success. If there are any, these could explain why some petitions are more successful than others. For example, look at factors such as number of signatures, media attention, having concrete demands & targets, etc.
    
-   If there is a **consistent** **negative correlation**, we can confidently say that petitions are likely not a positive contributor to policy changes. However, this does not exclude other uses for petitions (for example, as a means to collect leads).

### Hypothesis 2: Petitions do not shift public opinion

#### Explanation

According to this hypothesis, petitions do not cause a shift in public opinion.

One might be able to find correlations between a public opinion shift after a petitions with lots of signatures. However, correlation is not causation: perhaps other tactics happened at the same time, which created a shift in public opinion. Petitions could simply be an unacademic way of doing opinion polling.

### Hypothesis 3: Direct asks are more effective than indirect asks

#### Explanation

Some activist organisations use petitions even when they do not believe they are an effective way to shift public opinion or create policy change. They see petitions as a stepping stone for people: after someone has signed a petition, you can ask them to do more. This second (or third/fourth/etc) thing that you ask people to do is the thing of which you actually believe you can make a difference with.

In this scenario, the petition is an indirect ask: instead of saying, "_hey, do this thing that makes impact_", you say "_hey, do this thing that doesn't make impact, but afterwards you might be more willing to do the thing that does make impact_".

According to this hypothesis, it is more effective to immediately do a direct ask, instead of using an indirect ask (a petition) as a stepping stone.

The conversion rate might be lower for the direct ask in comparison to the direct ask (the conversion rate is the ratio of people that act after a call to action). This makes sense: for example, it is much easier to convince people to sign a petition than to convince them to do civil disobedience.

However, the indirect ask does not actually deliver the conversion (doing the thing that actually makes impact). Only a small portion of the people converting for the indirect ask, also convert for the second call to action. Overall, according to this hypothesis, the conversion rate is lower.

Within the expertise of grassroots organising, it is a common recommendation to make clear and direct asks for commitments. Of course, online organising is not exactly the same. And this common practice is not necessarily grounded in data-driven academics. However, this practice based on the hands-on experience of many experienced organisers cannot be ignored either.

#### Testing the hypothesis

See what happens if you divide your mailing list in 2 segments:

-   The first segment, you ask to sign a petition. You set up an email ladder in which you motivate people to do a higher barrier thing that makes more impact.
    
-   The second segment, you immediately start to motivate people to do the higher barrier thing that makes more impact.
    

Then measure which segment converts better.

In the above test, we assume people are already on your mailing list, which allows you to communicate with your audience. Even if people are not yet prepared to do the thing you want to them to do in the first instance, you have the ability to directly communicate with them and change their minds.

If you want a group of people of whom you do not yet have contact details to take a certain action, a different approach is needed to test the hypothesis. One way to test this is by advertising two landing pages (using the same segment methodology as described above, except for replacing the first email with an ad).

For both tests, there are a few factors to take into account:

-   If you have a different call to action, a different email, ad and/or landing page might also be required. A fair comparison would be 2 different sets of emails, ads and landing pages, each perfectly optimised for their respective call to action. Of course, there is no way of knowing when an email, ad or landing page is perfectly optimised. It takes time to try out several things, to see what setup works best.
    
-   In both our tests, we assume a digital approach, comparing a petition with another digital signup form. However, if you find that a high ask call to action is the only thing that actually makers impact, it might not make sense to use of digital marketing at all. Grassroots organising may provide a better return on investment: if you are asking people to do something big, this might just need to come from someone whom they are talking face to face with, rather than ads or mailings.

### Hypothesis 4: Indirect asks reduce willingness to do more

If you are using a petition as an indirect ask, of course, you cannot say "hey, I know this petition won't be effective, but I want to sign it anyway". Nobody would sign. So you would need to convince people that signing the petition will make a difference, even if you know it does not.

According to this hypothesis, if you are convincing people it is a good idea to sign a petition, you are making it less likely they will engage in higher barrier call to actions. After all, if you are able to convince people that taking a minute to fill out a form is enough to change the world, why would anyone go out to the streets to protest?

People may also feel like they have already done their part.
