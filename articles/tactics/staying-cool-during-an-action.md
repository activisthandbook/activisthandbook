### **Tips and Advice on Staying Cool On An Action:**

These tips are based on biological concepts and quirks that your body does to maintain your body temperature, whilst in the special circumstance of the grates, where you will not have access/easy access to conventional cooling methods. There is also some advice in this document that can be implemented if seen as useful to the action.  
 

1.  **Cool Your Pulse Points:** Applying something cool (such as a damp cloth or cold drink bottle where ice is not available) can quickly cool down your body. These areas are: the wrists, neck, temples, ankles, behind the knees, feet and the inside of elbows. Blood vessels in these areas are very close to the skin surface so cooling will have a direct impact in decreasing core body temperature.
    
2.  **Stay Hydrated to Maintain Sweating:** Sweat is your body’s natural cooling system so it's important to keep on sweating effectively.  To do so, please drink plenty of water! (Remember to replenish any salts lost during sweating via some food.
    
3.  **Maximize the Evaporation of Sweat:** This goes hand in hand with the last tip. Maximizing the air flow around your body will evaporate sweat more quickly, thus cooling you more effectively. Position yourself where there's good air circulation, or use a fan if you have access to one.
    
4.  **Controlled Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths allow for better oxygen exchange, which can help calm your nervous system and lower your heart rate, reducing the fight or flight response from stressful situations in the action that will make you feel hotter. A technique to try is [Box Breathing](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/wellbeing/breathing-exercises).
    
5.  **Cover Your Head:** Your head is a major site of heat exchange. Wearing a damp cloth or hat on your head can help keep your core temperature down, as it prevents heat build-up in the brain, which is very sensitive to overheating.
    
6.  **Lie Down, Get Up, Elevate Your Legs:** When sitting for long periods of time, blood pools in your legs, which can increase your overall body temperature. Lying down, getting up for a quick shake or elevating your legs can help improve circulation and reduce heat build-up. Refer to the NHS guidance on leg exercises for blood donors as minimal energy is required to do them, which will decrease heat expelled from releasing energy for muscle contractions.
    
7.  **Eat/Drink Light and Cool Foods/Liquids:** Eating heavy, hot meals will increase your metabolic rate, which will generate more heat. Also drinking hot liquids will of course increase your core temperature. Stick to lighter meals with high water content, such as fruits and salads, which are easier to digest and will help keep you cooler (if you can.) Also try to stick to cold liquids so that you don't boil your insides.
    

  
 

### **Advised implementations:**

1.  **Hand fans to increase airflow**: Can be used to promote sweat evaporation and thus cool down core body temperature. Max effectivity with electric fans instead of hand fans due to the heat expelled from physical movements in the arm, as a result of ATP being used up to release energy for those movements
    
2.  **Cooling cloths:** Can be purchased online (don't know where in person) and are designed to stay cool for prolonged periods of time when dampened with water. Can be used to cool down the head or pulse points with little effort 
    
3.  **Cooled liquids and ice-cream:** Can be used to cool down your core body temperature from the inside fast and effectively. Liquid bottles that are cold can also double-up as improvised ice packs or cloths to help cool down pulse points.
