Activist Handbook is looking for change-makers who are not afraid to think big. We want to train 350 million activists. But we do not have funding, and only a small number of volunteers. Help us take on this challenge!

> **Please read this page carefully before applying!** Not ready to make a big time commitment? You can also [**contribute in other ways**](/contribute).

## Our plan

All over the globe, green, social and progressive change-makers are trying to make a positive impact. But they often lack the skills to do so effectively.

Science shows that change happens when 3.5% of the population takes action. In 2050, there will be 10 billion people on this planet. That's why we are going to train 350 million activists.

To achieve this goal, we built an online knowledge-sharing platform. It works just like Wikipedia: everyone can edit our articles. This way, we allow activists across countries and movements to exchange their experiences with change-making.

### Our progress

-   We train about 4000 new activists every month. Our guides are read by change-makers across the globe.
    
-   We have written 450+ guides and collected 4.7K external resources.
    
-   About one person a day signs up to contribute to our campaign.
    

### Our challenges

-   Only a small number of people are writing and translating articles. We want a diverse crowd to contribute to our guides, because activism is different in every country.
    
-   Many activists don't know about Activist Handbook yet. We want more change-makers to make use of our free learning materials.
    
-   We do not have access to funding and our team of volunteers is small. We want to grow our capacity so that we can scale up our project.
    

We are looking for people like you to take on these challenges!

## How can I help?

We will find a role that fits your experience and interests. Most importantly, your role should contribute to these objectives:

-   **📝 Get more people to contribute to our handbook**
    
-   **📢 Increase the number of people making use of our platform**
    
-   **🔥 Grow our capacity: volunteers & funding**
    

For example, these are some ways you could help:

-   Welcome and support new contributors
    
-   Train new writers and review their contributions
    
-   Reach out to other movements for partnerships
    
-   Apply for grands and find other ways of funding
    

Feel free to suggest another way you think you could be of value to our team!

## Who are we looking for?

### Commitment

Coordinators spend at least at least **2 hours per week** on Activist Handbook. They are part of our team for a period of at least **6 months**.

If you are unable to commit this amount of time, we recommend you to check out our [other ways of contributing](/contribute).

### Experience

Anyone can join our team. Let us know what kind of experience you want to bring into our team and what you would like to learn more about.

Activist Handbook is all about learning, so we encourage you to step out of your comfort zone.

### Initiative

We expect members of our coordination team to show initiative and to be able to work independently.

Nobody will tell you what to do. We are all equal members of this team. We support each other and take responsibility for our part in the project.
