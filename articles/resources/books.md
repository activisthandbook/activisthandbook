## Q&A

### How can reading books help activists?

Reading books about activism can help to educate and inspire people to become more involved in social and political causes. These books can provide valuable information about the history of activism, the challenges activists face, and the impact they can have on society. Additionally, reading about the experiences of other activists can help people to feel less alone in their own activism and can provide them with ideas and motivation for their own work.

### What are the best books about activism?

In the list above, we have collected a large number of books that discuss activism. All of them are interesting to read. We try to extract the most valuable information from all the books we read and add them to Activist Handbook. We recommend you do the same! We would like to give a special thanks to the authors that made their books available for free, especially those that are licenced under a creative commons licence.
