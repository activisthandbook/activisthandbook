## Summary

### Chapter 1-5: Introduction

The climate crisis is a social crisis. It is not just a natural phenomenon. People are going to suffer and die on a mass scale, and society as we know it is going to collapse. The risk of human extinction, however small, is one that we cannot ignore.

The inevitable social unrest will increase the likelihood of fascism in some states (constitutions being changed to become less democratic), other states will collapse all together (resulting in [warlordism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord?utm_source=activisthandbook.org#:~:text=Warlordism%20was%20a%20widespread%2C%20dominant,early%20perception%20of%20%22nation%22.)). At the same time, in times of social unrest, the likelihood of social change in general also increases, which provides agency. In other words: radical democratic reform becomes a more realistic possibility. Either way, regime shifts (constitutional changes, not just governmental changes) become more likely. This provides us with the opportunity (and responsibility!) for pro-social reform.

However, this only happens if we act strategically. Historically, opportunity for social change has not always resulted in positive change. This was due to the lack of strategic design, [Occupy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement?utm_source=activisthandbook.org) and the [Egyptian revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Egyptian_revolution?utm_source=activisthandbook.org) being examples. To contrast this, Roger Hallam argues he has tried and tested key elements of strategic design, showcased in his repeated successes with Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain, Just Stop Oil and the H22 project.

So the question becomes: how do we operate strategically? Iterative strategy design is key, optimising for the least-worst outcome, instead of trying to find the perfect solution. Theory should continuously be updated based on findings from our own practice ([praxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process)?utm_source=activisthandbook.org)). In addition, we should reuse existing theories from capitalist society, adapting them to our needs ([exaptation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaptation?utm_source=activisthandbook.org)). For example, elements of sales theory can also be applied in grassroots organizing.
