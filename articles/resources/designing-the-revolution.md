> _U.N: No â€˜credible pathwayâ€™ to staying under 1.5C degrees (October 2022)_
> 
> _It's official: we are heading into the biggest shit-show in human history. Revolution is now inevitable, a great danger and a great opportunity to create a new revitalised democracy, or allow fascism to drag us all into hell._
> 
> _Far from it being the end it's just the beginning, there's everything to play for but only if we organise and resist as if our lives depend upon it, because they do._
> 
> _Roger Hallam has studied and designed social change for 35 years, he has initiated and helped run the biggest climate campaigns of the last decade he knows his stuff. This series details the theory and practice of a completely new way of reimagining and renewing society._
> 
> _At this moment in time this is the most important podcast series in the world, even if few people get it; that it's now or never for humanity. Roger walks his talk - these podcasts are recorded from prison. We're talking about real change here, no more blah blah blah._
