In this article, you will find a list of handbooks used by nonprofits and social movements. Use these examples as inspiration to write your own!

## How to write a handbook?

The most important advice we can give you: **do not try to reinvent the wheel!**

Why? Well, experienced campaigners from across the globe have written thousands of guides about change-making. In fact, on Activist Handbook alone, you can find 450+ guides and links to 4.7K external resources. And we're discovering new materials every day.

When writing a handbook, focus on what makes your organisation unique. Explain how your employees and volunteers can operate in your specific context. For everything else, link to existing resources out there.

> Are the existing resources out there not good enough? Improve them! Everyone can edit Activist Handbook.
