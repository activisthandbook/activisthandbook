Like Activist Handbook, their approach is based on shared leadership, modified consensus-based decision making, anti-oppression politics, and international and intersectional solidarity.

## Difference Activist Handbook and Beautiful Trouble

Beautiful Trouble is an awesome resource for change-makers around the globe. At Activist Handbook, we were very much inspired by their work, especially when it comes to their efforts to get a good international representation of activists.

We wanted to take this a step further: by allowing anyone to edit Activist Handbook, Wikipedia-style, we lower the barrier even further for troublemakers all over the world to share their knowledge and experiences. In addition, we actively integrate existing resources with our platform, so that together we can create the most comprehensive manual for rebels – available in all languages and with content adapted to local contexts.
