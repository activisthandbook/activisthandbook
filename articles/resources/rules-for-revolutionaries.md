**The book Rules for Revolutionaries is about how to change the world and how to be an effective activist. It is written by two experienced political activists, Bond and Exley, who draw on their own experiences as well as scientific research to provide a guide for revolutionaries.**

## **Introduction**

Do not be misled by the title: this book is about a political campaign for the US democratic primaries. It is not about a 'revolution' as this word is commonly understood (a forcible overthrow of a government or social order, in favour of a new system).

This book is primarily valuable for campaigners working in institutionalised contexts such as election campaigns and nonprofits. However, it also contains some useful insights for activists who do intend to start a revolution in the traditional meaning of the word.

In this article, we summarise the contents of this book. We know activists are busy people with little time to read a 200+ page book. However, if you find their rules as summarised below useful in your activism, we highly recommend you to read this book in its entirely, as it provides many practical tools!

## Summary

### Rule 1: You Won’t Get a Revolution If You Don’t Ask for One

You can inspire people to take action for a big cause. Movements need clear requests for solutions that match the scale of our challenges, and you need trustworthy, competent leaders to communicate them.

### Rule 2: The Revolution Will Not Be Handed to You on a Silver Platter

You can't customize the revolution to your liking. You have to deal with the challenges and the chances. And often it's in the middle of turmoil that you find the best situations for introducing radical changes.

### Rule 3: The Revolution Will Not Be Staffed

If you want big change, you will never have enough money to hire enough organizers to achieve your goals. The people who care about the issue are your best resource. They can volunteer their time and skills to make things happen. A few dedicated volunteers can do as much as a paid staff member. All you need is a list of people who are ready to take action and you can start building a strong organization.

### Rule 4: Fighting Racism Must Be at the Core of the Message to Everyone

A revolution must have these essential elements: people of color and immigrants as the leaders, anti-racism and anti-xenophobia as the main values, and white people who persuade other whites to join the multiracial movement instead of succumbing to fear and hate.

### Rule 5: Get on the phone!

To build stronger connections, stay updated with the situation, and solve hard problems, you need to communicate in real time even in our digital world. Good organizing means calling people every day. Use the newest tools for online meetings and scheduling to have more effective conversations with more people.

### Rule 6: The Work Is Distributed. The Plan Is Centralized.

A central plan is essential for distributed organizing, even if the tasks are divided among different people. Don't just let things happen randomly, create a connected system of production. Give parts of the work from a central, strategic campaign plan to a network of volunteer leaders who can work in different places and times, and with enough numbers, to achieve specific goals that make victory possible.

### Rule 7: The Revolution Will Be Funded—by Small Donations

A movement that relies on wealthy donors is doomed to fail. The people you want to mobilize are the ones you should focus on, and they will provide the necessary resources as your movement grows. Avoid becoming part of the system that exploits the people you want to help by pretending to represent them while depending on their indifference.

### Rule 8: Barnstorm!

Mass meetings are a tool to organize people into groups and start working right away. Keep improving your method to make your meetings more effective. The ability to repeat your meetings is essential for growing your movement.

### Rule 9: Fight the Tyranny of the Annoying

Keep your movement inclusive and welcoming by avoiding disruptive activists! Sometimes, a person with too much free time can take over a group and discourage the kind of people you want to join. Even if they have good intentions, it's better to ask them to leave your groups, and to create a culture where they won't stop the revolution.

### Rule 10: Give Away Your Passwords

Keep your movement inclusive and welcoming by avoiding disruptive activists! Sometimes, a person with too much free time can take over a group and discourage the kind of people you want to join. Even if they have good intentions, it's better to ask them to leave your groups, and to create a culture where they won't stop the revolution.

### Rule 11:Don’t Let the Perfect Be the Enemy of the Big

To scale up your impact, you cannot aim for perfection and depend on your resources. You have to delegate important tasks, training, and leadership roles to volunteers.

### Rule 12: Learn the Basics of Good Management

To lead a revolution, you need good management skills. Social change is hard and slow. People care a lot and want to do their best. But you can't do it alone, you need a team. And a team needs a good management culture. Working on a great team for a good cause is very rewarding for any organizer.

### Rule 13: If There Are No Nurses, I Don’t Want to Be Part of Your Revolution

Nurses are professionals who value care, empathy, and community, and they are strong supporters who can bring many others to your side. They have a practical professionalism that is honest and genuine, and they know from experience how the most critical issues of our time, such as economic justice, immigration rights, and environmental protection, can affect people's lives and health.

### Rule 14: Grow Complexity by Solving Problems as They Arise

When you are part of a movement, campaign, or revolution that is successful, things are changing and growing too quickly to plan everything in advance. But to become bigger, you need to deal with more and more complex issues. You can increase complexity by finding solutions for the real problems that come up in dialogue with the leaders who are involved.

### Rule 15: “Only Hire Staff Who Embrace the Rule “The Revolution Will Not Be Staffed”

A good rule for revolutionaries is to respect and appreciate the volunteer leaders who are doing most of the work. When you have the chance to hire more people, avoid those who might look down on, offend, or discourage the volunteers. And if you realize you have hired someone like that, let them go as soon as possible.

### Rule 16: Best Practices Become Worst Practices

Our world is always changing, so what worked well before might not work well now. Don't stick to the same old ways of doing things. Keep checking if they are still good or not, and be ready to change them or get rid of them if something else works better.

### Rule 17: The Revolution Is Not Just Bottom Up; It’s Peer to Peer

A successful movement empowers its leaders from the grassroots to collaborate as equals in a framework that helps them achieve their goals and grow. Your supporters have many skills and backgrounds; respecting them as equals is the best way to encourage them to take on leadership roles; working with them as you would with paid staff is the best way to retain them as leaders while enhancing their abilities.

### Rule 18: Repeat “Rinse and Repeat

To change the world, you need a lot of people working together with the right tools. You should teach your supporters some simple and effective methods that they can use over and over again to achieve your common goals. But that's not enough. You also need to find a way to keep growing your movement with new people.

### Rule 19: There’s No Such Thing as a Single-Issue Revolution

The revolution concerns everything. The people belong to communities that face various problems, and our fights are interrelated. That's why the revolution cannot be limited to one issue. Moreover, it will require all of us, each driven by the issues that directly affect us, collaborating to build the revolution.

### Rule 20: Get Ready for the Counterrevolution (to Include Your Friends)

When you are working for big change, and you are close to success, many people - even some you thought were on your side - will try to stop you. You will be shocked, puzzled, and waste time and energy if you are not ready for the backlash.

### Rule 21: Put Consumer Software at the Center

The way we use software on our devices has changed how we manage our lives and connect with others, and it is the new area where organizing can work or fail. With good use, tools that are free or cheap and open to everyone can make things easier and help teams collaborate across time and space for common goals. A bit of custom code can fill any important gaps that come up.

### Rule 22: People New to Politics Make the Best Revolutionaries

A growing movement attracts many people who are new to politics. Don't burden these eager leaders with outdated ideas from previous movements. We are not winning enough with our current leaders, so we should welcome more and new leaders.
