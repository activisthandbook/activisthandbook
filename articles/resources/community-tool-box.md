## Vision

The vision behind the Community Tool Box is that people â€” locally and globally â€” are better prepared to work together to change conditions that affect their lives. Our mission is to promote community health and development by connecting people, ideas, and resources.

With the belief that people can change their communities for the better, and informed by disciplines including applied behavior analysis, public health, and community psychology,Â partners at theÂ [University of Kansas](http://www.communityhealth.ku.edu/)Â and collaborating organizations developed the Community Tool Box as a public service.

Our fervent hope is that these tools can make it easier for people to take action to assure healthier and more just communities throughout the world.

The Community Tool Box is a public service of the Center for Community Health and DevelopmentÂ at the University of Kansas. The Center also provides a variety of [services](http://ctb.ku.edu/en/services) including technical assistance and training and participatory evaluation of community-based efforts.

## Funding

The Tool Box is sustained solely through donations at the private, university, and corporate level. As a supporter, your donation assures these tools for change remain available to communities. With your generous contribution, people on a local and global levelÂ can more effectively engage in community work, learning to assess, plan, evaluate, and sustain their efforts.

## History

The Community Tool Box was founded in 1995 by colleagues at the University of Kansas (including Stephen Fawcett, Jerry Schultz, and Vincent Francisco) in partnership with other national partners, including Bill Berkowitz and Tom Wolff. [](https://web.archive.org/web/20100617024030/http://communityhealth.ku.edu/publications/pdf/R16.pdf?utm_source=activisthandbook.org)Phil Rabinowitz has been a major contributor to content for the Community Tool Box. The website was created by the Schiefelbusch Institute for Life Span Studies at the university. With over 7,000 pages of information, the Community Tool Box contains guides and aids for problem solving common barriers faced in community development. In 2006, the website had a daily average of 3,315 visitors. It was initially an offline project which provided information to people about substance abuse and gun violence but later expanded to the Internet so that it could reach more people. The website serves as a resource for community improvement efforts, and has become widely used as text for courses in the following disciplines: public health, community health, social work, community psychology, and nursing.

The development of the Community Tool Box has been supported by funds from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the Kansas Health Foundation.

## Review

Why this resource is great:

-   Very extensive
    
-   Well organised
    
-   Based on academic research
    
-   All licensed under Creative commons!
    

Why this resource is not so great:

-   Difficult language used
    
-   Focussed on local communities, but overlooks bigger systemic issues. Almost all strategies proposed focus on making a difference locally. While this is great for people who want to make a direct impact, it doesn't bring us closer to something like radically overhauling our toxic capitalist society.
    
-   Focus on US context
