## **Improve this page**

This page needs to be filled with an overview of the content available on Rhizome Network.

IMPORTANT: The link available seems to not be updated anymore ([MORE INFO](https://rhizomenetwork.wordpress.com/)). They do have a new site at [http://rhizome.coop/](http://rhizome.coop/)

-   Please check if the content from the [archived site](https://rhizomenetwork.wordpress.com/resources/) is also available on the new website, or if they have different materials available.
-   Explain the difference between the new and the old sites.
