[**The Commons Library**](https://commonslibrary.org/) **is a collection of resources for activists and campaigners. The Commons Library furthers the work of progressive campaigners by providing them with the inspiration and knowledge of other campaigners.**

## **About the Commons Library**

The Commons Library is an online resource centre for those working towards social change. It offers a wide range of educational materials on topics such as campaign strategy, community organizing, digital campaigning, and diversity and inclusion.  Originally started in 2015 by the Australian political movement [GetUp!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GetUp!), it was relaunched in 2019 by its current team Commons Library Ltd.

These resources are available in various formats including videos, podcasts, articles, and training materials. The library is free to use and aims to be inclusive, accessible, and beneficial to many.

It seeks to collect and share the key lessons and resources of progressive movements around the world. The Commons Library also pays respects to the traditional owners of the land on which it operates and advocates for Indigenous self-determination and justice.

Users can search for resources on the home page, browse topics and collections, use filters to refine their search, and access curated guides. The library also has a team of Librarians available to answer questions and provide recommendations.

The Commons Library is a go-to resource for social change and activism. It is a comprehensive and user-friendly website that provides a wide range of tools, resources, and guides for those interested in social and ecological justice. The focus on intersectionality is particularly noteworthy. The Commons Library is free to use and is recommended by a number of organizations and individuals who have found it to be an invaluable resource for their work. Charlie Wood of Tipping Point, Maya Newell of In My Blood It Runs, Lexie Keller Sheard of TEAR Australia, Aliya Ahmad of Democracy in Colour, and Sarina Foulstone of Council on the Ageing NSW (COTA) have all spoken highly of the Commons Library and its usefulness in their work.

## Improve this page

### Why do we have this page?

In our resources chapter, we have compiled an extensive list of external resources that activists can learn from. We use this list of resources to bring together small bits of knowledge from all over the internet into one comprehensive handbook. The Commons Library is one of those resources.

This page exists for various purposes:

-   **SEO:**
    
    -   People looking up the Commons Library might end up on this page, and get to know other resources for activists as well.
        
    -   In addition, by linking to and creating content about other organisations that provide training materials to activists, we help search engines understand what our website is about.
        
    -   Finally, we only link and write content about organisations we like. By linking to their websites, we give them an additional authority on the topics they write about. This helps them show up higher in search rankings (in comparison to websites that we do not like, and thus do not link to). This way, we make it easier for activists to find the right resources.
        
-   **For our editors:** We create an overview of all content that the Commons Library has to offer, and how this is related to content on our website. We provide suggestions how both of our resources can be combined. This way, we create a single well-organised and collaborative knowledge-base for activists. In other words: we ‘steal’ their content for the purpose of making it better (and we welcome everyone to 'steal' our work back).
