**All over the globe people are taking action for climate justice. In this article, we have put together a collection of resources for environmental protest movements.**

As the world faces an unprecedented climate crisis, people are taking to the streets to demand change. From the [Extinction Rebellion](/movements/extinction-rebellion) protests in the UK, to the Youth Climate Strike in the US, to the [Greta Thunberg](/people/greta-thunberg)\-inspired school strikes happening all over the world, people are rising up to demand action on climate change.

If you are reading this, you are probably already aware of the many ways in which climate change is affecting our planet. Perhaps you have read about the melting glaciers, the billions of tons of plastic in our oceans, or the drastic decline in the populations of many species of animals. Or maybe you have experienced the effects of climate change firsthand, in the form of more extreme weather conditions or changes in your local ecosystem.

Whatever your reason for wanting to take action on climate change, this guide is for you. Here, you will find information on some of the most effective ways to make a difference. Whether you want to lobby your government for change, or join a climate protest, you will find the resources you need here. So let’s get started!

## Guides for climate activists

If you're looking for [resources](/resources) to help you get involved in a climate protest movement, you've come to the right place. In this article, we've gathered a collection of articles, guides, and [tools](/tools) to help you get started.

We've compiled tips on [how to organise a protest](/organising/protest), how to campaign for climate justice, and how to [stay safe](/wellbeing) while protesting. We've also gathered information on the [legal rights](/rights) of protesters, and ways to [mobilise and do outreach](/communication) to grow your movement.

Finally, we've collected a list of [training organisations](/trainings) to support your movement.

## Action ideas

Are you looking for inspiration for your next climate action? Here are some suggestions:

**Host a mock trial:** This could be a public event where a group of activists "try" a corporation or government agency for their role in causing or perpetuating climate change. The trial could include witnesses, evidence, and a jury of participants, and could be used to educate people about the issue and build support for your campaign.

**Organize a "die-in":** This is a common tactic used by activists to simulate the consequences of a particular issue, in this case the potential loss of life due to climate change. To do this, activists would lie down in a public place and remain still for a set period of time, creating a powerful visual that can be used to draw media attention and engage with the public.

**Create a "guerrilla garden":** This is a tactic where activists covertly plant flowers, trees, or other plants in a public space without permission, in order to beautify the area and make a statement about the importance of nature and the environment. This can be a fun and creative way to engage with the public and promote your campaign message.

**Hold a "funeral" for the planet:** This action would involve activists hosting a mock funeral to symbolize the loss of the planet due to climate change. This could include a casket, mourners dressed in black, and a procession or procession through a public space. This can be a powerful and emotional way to draw attention to your cause.

**Organize a "clean-up" event:** This is a tactic where activists organize a public event to clean up litter, trash, or other debris from a particular location. This can be a great way to engage with the public and promote your campaign message, and can also serve as a tangible example of the work you are doing to protect the environment.

## Messaging

Make sure to convey a sense of urgency. Do not say “climate change”, use phrases like this instead:

1.  The earth is on the brink of a **climate catastrophe**.
    
2.  Time is running out to act on the **climate crisis**.
    
3.  The climate crisis is an **unprecedented threat** to humanity.
    
4.  The ocean's **ecosystems are collapsing**, putting countless species in danger.
    
5.  We must take action now before it's too late and our planet is **irrevocably damaged**.

## Q&A

### Does climate activism work?

Climate activism can be effective in raising awareness and pressuring governments and businesses to take action on climate change. There are many different forms of activism, and some are more effective than others. Make sure to read our chapter on strategy to learn more about [making effective plans](/strategy).

### How do I get involved with climate activism?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to become a climate activist may vary depending on your individual skills, interests, and experiences. However, some tips on how to become a climate activist include:

1.  Get informed about the issue of climate change and the science behind it. This will help you to understand the urgency of the issue and the actions that need to be taken to address it.
    
2.  Connect with others who are also concerned about climate change. This can be done online or in person, and will help you to feel supported as you take action.
    
3.  Get involved in local and national campaigns on climate change. This could involve writing to your elected representatives, attending protests or rallies, or speaking out about the issue in your community.
    
4.  Use your skills and talents to support the climate change movement. This could include using your art or writing to raise awareness, using your social media platforms to amplify the message, or using your technical skills to develop new tools or platforms for activism.
    
5.  Be persistent and don’t give up. It is important to remember that change takes time, and even small actions can have a big impact when done collectively.
    

### How do I organise a climate protest?

To [organise a climate protest](/organising/protest), you will need to gather a group of people who are passionate about the cause and willing to take action. You will need to choose a date, time, and location for the protest, and promote it through social media and other channels. On the day of the protest, make sure to have signs and banners to attract attention, and be prepared to chant and [march](/tactics/march).

### What climate movements exist?

Here are three examples of climate movements, but there are many more:

[Fridays for Future](/fridays-for-future) is a youth-led climate movement that began in August 2018, when Greta Thunberg, then 15 years old, started protesting in front of the Swedish parliament every Friday for action on the climate crisis. The movement has since spread to over 150 countries, with school students striking on Fridays to demand climate justice.

[Extinction Rebellion](/extinction-rebellion) is a global climate movement that uses nonviolent civil disobedience to demand action on the climate crisis. The movement was founded in the UK in May 2018 by academics Roger Hallam and Gail Bradbrook, and has since grown to include tens of thousands of people in over 80 countries.

Youth for Climate is a youth-led climate movement that was started in the Netherlands in 2019. The movement has since spread to other countries, with youth taking to the streets to demand climate action from their governments.
