## Action ideas

Are you looking for inspiration for your next climate action? Here are some suggestions:

**Host a mock trial:** This could be a public event where a group of activists "try" a corporation or government agency for their role in causing or perpetuating climate change. The trial could include witnesses, evidence, and a jury of participants, and could be used to educate people about the issue and build support for your campaign.

**Organize a "die-in":** This is a common tactic used by activists to simulate the consequences of a particular issue, in this case the potential loss of life due to climate change. To do this, activists would lie down in a public place and remain still for a set period of time, creating a powerful visual that can be used to draw media attention and engage with the public.

**Create a "guerrilla garden":** This is a tactic where activists covertly plant flowers, trees, or other plants in a public space without permission, in order to beautify the area and make a statement about the importance of nature and the environment. This can be a fun and creative way to engage with the public and promote your campaign message.

**Hold a "funeral" for the planet:** This action would involve activists hosting a mock funeral to symbolize the loss of the planet due to climate change. This could include a casket, mourners dressed in black, and a procession or procession through a public space. This can be a powerful and emotional way to draw attention to your cause.

**Organize a "clean-up" event:** This is a tactic where activists organize a public event to clean up litter, trash, or other debris from a particular location. This can be a great way to engage with the public and promote your campaign message, and can also serve as a tangible example of the work you are doing to protect the environment.

3.  The climate crisis is an **unprecedented threat** to humanity.
    
4.  The ocean's **ecosystems are collapsing**, putting countless species in danger.
