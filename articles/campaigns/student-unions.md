**This guide will tell you everything you need to know about student unions. It will explain what student unions are, what they do, and how they can benefit you as a student.**

A student union is an organization that represents students at a college or university. Student unions provide a variety of services to students, including social and cultural activities, advocacy, and support. Student unions are also a great way to get involved in your community and make new friends.

Some challenges that student unions may face include a lack of funding, a lack of engagement from students, and a lack of cooperation from the administration.

## Action ideas

**Host a "solidarity training" event:** This could be a public event where student union members and supporters come together to learn skills and strategies for building power and solidarity within the student movement. This could include training in organizing, negotiating, lobbying, and other skills that can help student unions be more effective in their campaigns.

**Organize a "class strike":** This is a tactic where students refuse to attend classes in order to put pressure on their school and to demand better education, resources, and conditions. A well-organized and well-executed class strike can be a powerful tool for building power and winning concessions from school administrators.

**Host a "teach-in":** This is a tactic where activists come together to educate and engage with the public about a particular issue or campaign. For a student union campaign, this could involve hosting a public event where student union members and experts share information and insights about the importance of student rights and the challenges facing the education system.

**Create a "guerrilla theater" performance:** This is a tactic where activists use performance art and theater to draw attention to their cause and engage with the public. For a student union campaign, this could involve creating a short play or skit that portrays the struggles and challenges faced by students, and using it to educate and engage with the public.
