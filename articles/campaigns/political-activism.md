## Improve this page

We've got some bad news: this page appears to be very empty still. But you can make it better! Here's how:

-   Add a list of links to the best resources for political campaigners (both on Activist Handbook and elsewhere)
    
-   Create an outline for this guide: what challenges that people in politics face should we discuss?
