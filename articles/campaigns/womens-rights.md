## Action ideas

**Organize a "silent protest":** This is a tactic where activists gather in a public space and hold signs or banners with messages about women's rights, but remain silent and do not engage with the public or the authorities. This can be a powerful and attention-grabbing way to promote your campaign message and to engage with the public, without risking arrest or harassment.

**Host a "mural painting" event:** This is a tactic where activists come together to paint a large mural on a public wall, depicting women's rights issues and the intersectionality with other causes such as skin color or poverty. This can be a powerful and attention-grabbing way to promote your campaign message and to engage with the public, and can be done in a safe and legal way.

**Use civil disobedience:** This could involve activists organizing a sit-in or a blockade at a government building or other institution that is failing to protect women's rights, and deliberately breaking a law or a rule in order to protest against the injustice. The activists could also engage in other non-violent forms of civil disobedience, such as refusing to pay taxes or to comply with other unjust laws or rules.

**Use cultural disobedience:** This could involve activists organizing a public performance or exhibition of art, music, or dance that challenges and subverts the norms and values of an oppressive system or culture that is oppressing women. This could include performances of feminist poetry, songs, or plays, or exhibitions of paintings, sculptures, or installations that depict women's rights issues and the intersectionality with other causes.
