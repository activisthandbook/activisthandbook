## Short-term goals

### Discontent with Major Parties

Many voters feel that the two major US political parties (Democrat and Republican) do not adequately represent their political views. Third-party candidates may offer policies that align more closely with beliefs and priorities.

1.  **Desire for Change:** While some voters may agree with an established party candidate, they may feel that the candidate will not be able to bring about meaningful change. Alternatively, they may see the entire established party as being too entrenched in existing systems and, therefore, unable to create meaningful change within them. 
    
2.  **Single Issue Voter:** Whereas established political parties must appeal to a wide base of voters, third-party candidates are free to ardently champion for specific policies and priorities. This may lead to _principle over pragmatism_, when a voter chooses to vote for a candidate who truly represents their values even if that candidate has a lower chance of winning. 
    
3.  **Centrist Voter**: Alternatively, third-party candidates may position themselves as more centrist. By offering a middle ground instead of strictly aligning with the ideologies of a major party, they may appeal to voters who agree with some aspects of both establishment parties but not all aspects of either one.
    

### Breaking the Two-Party Duopoly

Critics argue that the dominance of the two major parties limits political competition, stifles alternative voices, and guarantees the continuation of the status quo.

Voting for a third-party candidate is seen as a way to break this duopoly and encourage a more diverse political landscape. Advocates argue that a more diverse political landscape could potentially lead to a broader range of policy options and increase accountability among politicians and civil servants. 

## Long-term goals

### Diversifying the Political Landscape

While this is often a short-term goal for a particular office or race, this is also a long-term goal for the entire political system.

The election of third-party candidates could contribute to a shift away from the dominance of the establishment parties. This has the potential to lead to more coalition-building, negotiation, and collaboration among multiple parties; this would lead, ultimately, towards a more pluralistic political system. 

### Policy Influence and Building a Sustainable Movement

Third parties often focus on a specific policy, set of issues, or ideological position that may get de-prioritized by the established parties. Electing a third-party candidate pushes these issues into the mainstream public discourse. This could, ideally, lead to electing candidates at various levels of government to enact meaningful cross-system change. 

### Increasing Accountability and Fostering Innovation

A broader range of parties can lead to additional competition, and elected officials may be more responsive to the needs and demands of a diverse electorate. Additionally, it encourages the adoption of new and creative approaches to addressing societal changes as they arise. 

### Changing Political Culture

Current establishment parties are quite tribal, leading to an atmosphere of divisiveness. A Third-party candidate may seek to change this political culture by promoting cooperation, compromise, and inclusivity. 

### Encouraging Civic Engagement 

Third-party movements often emphasize grassroots organizing and community engagement. By electing candidates at every level, they may hope to encourage citizens to become more involved in the political process and take an active role in shaping their communities.

## Do any independent/third-parties currently exist?

### Yes! These are the alternative political parties in the USA

#### Libertarian

This party tends to lean conservative. It advocates for limited government, individual freedoms, and free-market capitalism.

#### Green

This party tends to lean progressive. It emphasizes environmentalism, social justice, and grassroots organization.

#### Constitution

This party is conservative and focuses on a strict adherence to the US Constitution along with limited government.

#### Working Families

This party is progressive and often cross-endorses Democratic candidates.

#### Socialist (PSL)

This party advocates for socialist and progressive policies. They may cross-endorse with Working Families candidates and/or Democratic candidates.

#### Independent

This is a catch-all designation for any candidate who chooses not to affiliate with any of the above political parties. Because of this, the platform of this "party,"

#### State-Specific Parties

Alaskan Independence Party: Advocates for the state's independence from the United States.

American Independent Party of California: Represents a right-wing, far-conservative stance

Conservative Party of New York State: Promotes conservative principles and values

Hawaii Aloha: This party focuses on issues related to Native Hawaiians, the environment, and social justice.

Independence Party of Minnesota: Centrist party that aims to provide an alternative to the established two-party system

Mountain Party of West Virginia: Focuses on environmental and social justice issues, sometimes used interchangeably with the Green Party within the state

Note: minor parties are born and petitioned for all the time. As such, this list may not be complete. View each state Secretary of State page to verify.

## Presidential candidate nomination process for third parties in USA

### Libertarian, Socialism, and Green Parties

Both of these political parties have primary processes that mimic the process of established parties: there are state level primaries that ultimately lead to a national convention where the final candidate is selected via delegates.

**State Level Primaries/Conventions** serve not just to narrow down the candidates, but to determine the allocation of delegates at the national convention.

**National Conventions** provide a chance for the final round of candidates to pitch their policies to delegates via debates. To be included in these debates, a candidate must receive at least ten percent of the number of registered delegates at the beginning of the convention.

**Libertarian-specific regulations**:  to be nominated for president or vice president, a candidate must collect the signatures of at least 30 registered delegates. Each delegate may nominate one candidate for each office.

**Green-specific regulations**:

-   Candidates are required to fill out a questionnaire that will be made public to GP Voters ([https://gpus.org/committees/presidential-campaign-support/2024-candidates-questionnaire/](https://gpus.org/committees/presidential-campaign-support/2024-candidates-questionnaire/)) 
    
-   Candidate may not be affiliated, or be a member of, the established Democrat or Republican party. If Candidate is affiliated with, or a member of, any party other than the GP, this will need to be approved by GP leadership. 
    
-   Candidate’s membership in GP will be terminated in they use SuperPACS
    
-   Candidate must submit a nationwide ballot access plan

### Nomination Process for Additional Parties

**Constitution Party**: Unfortunately, this party does not currently have a working website. So, we are unable to verify how they decide on their candidates.

**Working Families**: Currently, this party does not elect candidates from within the party. Instead, candidates from other parties (or without party affiliation) can seek their endorsement. If received, WF will work to assist those candidates in their election efforts. You can apply for endorsement here: [https://act.workingfamilies.org/forms/apply-for-the-wfp-endorsement](https://act.workingfamilies.org/forms/apply-for-the-wfp-endorsement)

**Independent**: a true independent candidate, unaffiliated from any party, will not need to receive a nomination in the conventional sense. They will, however, need to build a grassroots coalition in order to ensure their name is on the ballot in each of the 50 states, following the rules and procedures of each state as they go.

## What are the regulations/rules for getting a third-party presidential candidate on a national ballot?

### This is a complex process.

### Below, we will provide an overview of each step. We will also provide charts that include state specific rules and regulations as we go.

#### A third-party candidate can appear on the ballot of a given state in one of three ways:

1: The candidate can run as a "write in."

1.  The candidate can run as the nominated candidate for a pre-existing third party political entity.
    
2.  The candidate can, with help, create a third party political entity and, once that entity has gained recognition, run as its nominated candidate.
    

#### For the purposes of this guide, we will focus on the second and third options.

### **Before we discuss the regulations for forming a new political party,** **here is a chart to indicate _which parties currently exist_ in each of the 50 United States.**

Note that each of these parties will have a slightly different nomination process and that process may vary from state to state. If you are interested in garnering the nomination from an existing third-party political entity, you should reach out to them directly.

This portion of the guide is still in progress and will be updated with the remainder of states as the authors are able.

**If your state does not currently recognize the party you would like** your candidate to run under, you have 2 options: _you can run as an independent/write in candidate_, or _you can petition to have your party of choice recognized_ on the ballot and affiliated with your candidate's name.

### **First, we will provide the guidelines for getting a candidate's name on the ballot without party affiliation.**

Depending on the state, this might be classified as "independent" or "write in."

## So, how do we build a coalition large enough to succeed in getting someone on the ballot?

(Note: elaboration will be provided as this page is updated)

### Establish the party in each state

**(taken/adapted from Project 2024)**

-   **Step 1** is to find your community within your congressional district. 
    
    There are several ways to do this:
    
    1. [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/vf7znVFC)
    
    2\. Reach out to local labor unions.
    
    3\. Reach out to local organizers as they have been leading the resistant and revolution for many years. An example would be the [Party for Socialism and Liberation](https://pslweb.org) (PSL). Ask these leaders how you can help. Ask if they have a candidate in mind.
    
    4\. Unite under the goal of putting an independent into U. S. House of Representatives.
    
    5\. Become a real part of this newfound community, lending a hand in whatever capacity is available to you.
    
-   **Step 2** is to find your candidate.
    
    As stated in the previous chapter, try to find local unions/third party groups in your area and see if they already have candidates in mind. 
    
    If there are no candidates, find one along with the help of your newfound community.
    
    Below are some resources to help you get started.
    
    [TheGreenPapers.com](http://TheGreenPapers.com) is a great resource. It updates regularly, and lets you see registered candidates, important political events, and deadlines.
    
    Follow this link to find the candidates that have registered to have their names on the ballot in 2024:

Most states will only recognize a third political party if candidates under that party gain a certain percentage of the vote. It is important to focus on the larger picture of building the party as a whole and not just on a single candidate in a single election.

## Challenges and Potential Strategies to Overcome Them

### The spoiler problem

The two-party system in the US is unusual. Most democracies have multi-party systems and it is rare for a single party to have a majority in the legislature. The main reason the US has a two-party system is because most general elections use **first-the-post voting**, a "winner takes all" system.

In first-the-post, the candidate with the most votes wins, regardless of whether they win 70%, 40% or even 24.5% of the vote. [The latter has happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)?utm_source=activisthandbook.org), but it's rare. In practice, first-past-the-post encourages voters to unite around two parties, because a third party risks the **spoiler effect** (also called **splitting the vote**).

If a right-wing party wins 40% of the vote and two left-wing parties win 30%, then the right-wing party wins, even though 60% of the votes were for a left-wing party. A real life example is the 2000 presidential election. Ralph Nader ran a more left-wing campaign than Al Gore and took 97,488 votes in Florida, where Bush defeated Gore by 537 votes. Nader appears to have tipped the state to Bush, and with it the presidency.

In practice, it's not that simple. One study found that while Nader had been a spoiler, had he not run, many of his voters would have abstained or voted for Bush. In the UK, the Liberal Democrats have won seats where the traditional center left Labour Party have been weak.

By contrast, proportional systems give seats to parties in proportion to the number of votes they receive, so voters can usually vote for minor parties without having to worry about the spoiler effect. Other non-proportional systems such as two-round systems (known in the US as top-two primaries or jungle primaries) and ranked choice voting reduce the spoiler effect.

Other countries with first-past-the-post voting, such as Canada and the UK have also tended to have a two party system, but it's not nearly as rigid. Another reason is that the US normally decides party nominees with **primary elections**. It is usually easier for outsider candidates to win a major party nomination, rather than trying to win as a third party candidate.

Potential strategies to avoid the spoiler effect:

-   Start with small, local races; try running for a council seat instead of the mayor, or try winning a handful of legislative seats rather than the governor. [Micah Sifry has argued](https://newrepublic.com/article/146884/america-stuck-two-parties?utm_source=activisthandbook.org) that third parties have focused too much on long-shot runs for the presidency and would be better off building up something at a local level.
    
-   Avoid running in places that are battlegrounds between the major parties.
    
-   Make a strategic alliance with a major party, whether a formal electoral pact or an informal agreement. At a minimum, you avoid heavy campaigning in each other's battlegrounds.
    
-   Consider an alternative strategy of running in a major party's primary, while making your outsider intentions clear. You could even campaign as a third party candidate despite officially being a third party nominee.
    
-   Support campaigns for electoral reform, especially when this can be done through a ballot proposition. Proportional systems are the best for third parties, but top-two and ranked choice systems are more achievable.
    

### The winnability problem

Being seen as a winner is vital to winning an election. A growing number of Americans want to vote for a third party but don't, because they don't see any of their campaign ads or hear about them in the media.

Winning a federal or statewide race means campaigning across a large population and area, and American elections are the most expensive in the world. The organization and funding this requires can be daunting for a new grassroots movement.

Fortunately, money is not everything. [In 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won a primary challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_New_York%27s_14th_congressional_district_election?utm_source=activisthandbook.org) despite being outspent 18 to 1. [In 2014, Eric Cantor lost a primary challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Cantor?utm_source=activisthandbook.org#2014_Republican_primary_and_resignation) despite outspending his opponent 40 to 1. Often, you only need to do enough campaigning so that you look like one of the top two candidates. If voters like your message, it can take care of the rest.

The media may look like a closed fortress, and journalists have often underestimated the chances of outsider candidates. The good news is that the media love both novelty and stories about underdogs, which can play well into a third party campaign with some traction.

Potential strategies to make yourself look like a winner:

-   Again, start with small, local races.
    
-   Consider avoiding television ads. They are expensive but are bringing diminishing returns.
    
-   Get your volunteers canvassing door-to-door. It's one of the most effective ways to win voters yet can cost nothing.
    
-   Get your volunteers to put campaign signs outside their houses. It costs little and is one of the best ways to look like you're a contender.
