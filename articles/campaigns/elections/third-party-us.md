## Short-term goals

### Discontent with Major Parties

Many voters feel that the two major US political parties (Democrat and Republican) do not adequately represent their political views. Third-party candidates may offer policies that align more closely with beliefs and priorities.

1.  **Desire for Change:** While some voters may agree with an established party candidate, they may feel that the candidate will not be able to bring about meaningful change. Alternatively, they may see the entire established party as being too entrenched in existing systems and, therefore, unable to create meaningful change within them. 
    
2.  **Single Issue Voter:** Whereas established political parties must appeal to a wide base of voters, third-party candidates are free to ardently champion for specific policies and priorities. This may lead to _principle over pragmatism_, when a voter chooses to vote for a candidate who truly represents their values even if that candidate has a lower chance of winning. 
    
3.  **Centrist Voter**: Alternatively, third-party candidates may position themselves as more centrist. By offering a middle ground instead of strictly aligning with the ideologies of a major party, they may appeal to voters who agree with some aspects of both establishment parties but not all aspects of either one. 
    
    ### Breaking the Two-Party Duopoly
    
    Critics argue that the dominance of the two major parties limits political competition, stifles alternative voices, and guarantees the continuation of the status quo.
    
    Voting for a third-party candidate is seen as a way to break this duopoly and encourage a more diverse political landscape. Advocates argue that a more diverse political landscape could potentially lead to a broader range of policy options and increase accountability among politicians and civil servants. 
    

## Long-term goals

### Diversifying the Political Landscape

While this is often a short-term goal for a particular office or race, this is also a long-term goal for the entire political system.

The election of third-party candidates could contribute to a shift away from the dominance of the establishment parties. This has the potential to lead to more coalition-building, negotiation, and collaboration among multiple parties; this would lead, ultimately, towards a more pluralistic political system. 

### Policy Influence and Building a Sustainable Movement

Third parties often focus on a specific policy, set of issues, or ideological position that may get de-prioritized by the established parties. Electing a third-party candidate pushes these issues into the mainstream public discourse. This could, ideally, lead to electing candidates at various levels of government to enact meaningful cross-system change. 

### Increasing Accountability and Fostering Innovation

A broader range of parties can lead to additional competition, and elected officials may be more responsive to the needs and demands of a diverse electorate. Additionally, it encourages the adoption of new and creative approaches to addressing societal changes as they arise. 

### Changing Political Culture

Current establishment parties are quite tribal, leading to an atmosphere of divisiveness. A Third-party candidate may seek to change this political culture by promoting cooperation, compromise, and inclusivity. 

### Encouraging Civic Engagement 

Third-party movements often emphasize grassroots organizing and community engagement. By electing candidates at every level, they may hope to encourage citizens to become more involved in the political process and take an active role in shaping their communities.

## Presidential candidate nomination process for third parties in USA

### Libertarian, Socialism, and Green Parties

Both of these political parties have primary processes that mimic the process of established parties: there are state level primaries that ultimately lead to a national convention where the final candidate is selected via delegates.

**State Level Primaries/Conventions** serve not just to narrow down the candidates, but to determine the allocation of delegates at the national convention.

**National Conventions** provide a chance for the final round of candidates to pitch their policies to delegates via debates. To be included in these debates, a candidate must receive at least ten percent of the number of registered delegates at the beginning of the convention.

**Libertarian-specific regulations**:  to be nominated for president or vice president, a candidate must collect the signatures of at least 30 registered delegates. Each delegate may nominate one candidate for each office.

**Green-specific regulations**:

-   Candidates are required to fill out a questionnaire that will be made public to GP Voters ([https://gpus.org/committees/presidential-campaign-support/2024-candidates-questionnaire/](https://gpus.org/committees/presidential-campaign-support/2024-candidates-questionnaire/)) 
    
-   Candidate may not be affiliated, or be a member of, the established Democrat or Republican party. If Candidate is affiliated with, or a member of, any party other than the GP, this will need to be approved by GP leadership. 
    
-   Candidate’s membership in GP will be terminated in they use SuperPACS
    
-   Candidate must submit a nationwide ballot access plan

### Nomination Process for Additional Parties

**Constitution Party**: Unfortunately, this party does not currently have a working website. So, we are unable to verify how they decide on their candidates.

**Working Families**: Currently, this party does not elect candidates from within the party. Instead, candidates from other parties (or without party affiliation) can seek their endorsement. If received, WF will work to assist those candidates in their election efforts. You can apply for endorsement here: [https://act.workingfamilies.org/forms/apply-for-the-wfp-endorsement](https://act.workingfamilies.org/forms/apply-for-the-wfp-endorsement)

**Independent**: a true independent candidate, unaffiliated from any party, will not need to receive a nomination in the conventional sense. They will, however, need to build a grassroots coalition in order to ensure their name is on the ballot in each of the 50 states, following the rules and procedures of each state as they go.
