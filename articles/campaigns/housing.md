**People all over the world protest for affordable housing. On Activist Handbook, you can find resources on how to organise yourself effectively.**

## Guides for housing activists

We have written a chapter on [how to build a movement](/organising), which you can use to learn how to organise yourself effectively to fight for tenant rights together. Before getting right into it by organising a housing protest, we recommend you to think about your [long term strategy](/strategy). Make sure to prepare yourself for a long run, because it can take a while before politicians finally start to hear you. This is why it is also important that you [do not burn out your volunteers](/wellbeing).

Most people immediately think of a protest march, when wanting to bring attention to a cause. However, you can also get creative and check out our [tactics](/tactics) chapter. You will need to [promote your action](/communication) beforehand. If you do not have a large audience on your movement's [social media](/tools/social-media/) yet, you use the network of your active volunteers. And remember: your fight against exorbitant rent prices likely does not end after one action. You can use actions to recruit new people, so that you can mobilise more for the next one.

The municipality may sympathise more with landlords, and try to intimidate you with a large police presence. It is good to know, however, that you have certain [legal rights](/rights) as an activist. Even if you get arrested, there are certain things that the police may and may not do to you. We also recommend to find a lawyer with experience defending activists to support your movement.

## Messaging

-   **"Pocket-filling leeches"** - This phrase evokes the idea of landlords sucking money out of people's pockets without providing any value in return.
    
-   **"Capitalist cockroaches"** - This phrase uses a metaphor to compare landlords to pests that are hard to get rid of and that thrive on exploiting people.
    
-   **"Housing hustlers"** \- This phrase suggests that landlords are scamming people and taking advantage of them for financial gain.
    
-   **"Rent gougers"** - This phrase implies that landlords are charging excessive and unreasonable rents, and taking advantage of people's need for housing.
    
-   **"Property parasites"** - This phrase suggests that landlords are feeding off of the housing market and taking advantage of people's need for shelter.
    

And here are some more tips for formulating a message for affordable housing activism:

**Start with a clear, concise, and compelling message:** Your message should be easy to understand, and it should clearly and concisely communicate the problem you are trying to solve and the solution you are proposing. Avoid using jargon or technical language, and focus on explaining the issue in simple, relatable terms.

**Use emotion to your advantage:** Affordable housing is an emotional issue, and it can be powerful to tap into people's feelings and emotions when crafting your message. Consider using language that evokes feelings of frustration, anger, or compassion, and try to connect with people on a personal level by sharing stories and experiences.

**Frame the issue in a way that resonates with your audience:** The way you frame the issue can have a big impact on how people respond to your message. For example, if you are trying to convince policymakers to take action on affordable housing, you might frame the issue as a moral imperative or a social justice issue. If you are trying to engage with the general public, you might frame the issue in terms of the economic benefits of affordable housing, or the personal impact on people's lives.

**Use creative language and imagery:** A creative and memorable message can be a powerful tool for getting people's attention and engaging with your audience. Consider using metaphors, analogies, or other forms of figurative language to make your message more interesting and engaging. You can also use imagery and visual aids to help people understand your message and to make it more memorable.

**Get public support:** One of the most effective ways to get your message heard is to build a broad coalition of supporters who can help amplify your message and increase its visibility. This can include other activists, community organizations, politicians, celebrities, and others who share your goals and can help you spread your message to a wider audience.

## Action tactics

### Inspiration for your next action

Here are a few creative action ideas that affordable housing activists can use to draw media attention:

**Host a "rent strike":** This is a tactic where a group of tenants withhold their rent payments in order to protest against unfair or unaffordable housing conditions. This can be a powerful way to draw attention to your cause and to put pressure on landlords and policymakers to address the issue.

**Use public theatre to make a point:** Activists are dressed in yellow protective suits with oxygen masks. They pretend that landlords are cockroaches. They have also made a big house from papier-mÃ¢chÃ© and there are people playing landlords in suits holding suitcases full with money.

**Organize a "homeless sleep-out":** This is a tactic where activists spend a night sleeping outside in a public place to raise awareness about homelessness and the lack of affordable housing. This can be a powerful and emotional way to engage with the public and to draw media attention to your cause.

**Create a public art installation:** This could be anything from a mural or street art to a sculpture or performance art piece. The key is to make it visually striking and thought-provoking, and to tie it to your campaign message in a way that is both creative and memorable.

**Host a music festival or concert:** Music can be a powerful tool for activism, and a well-organized music festival or concert can be a great way to draw media attention and engage with your audience. Consider partnering with local musicians and bands, and use the event to promote your campaign and its message.

**Organize a "housing lottery":** This is a tactic where activists create a fake lottery in which the prize is a free or affordable home. This can be a fun and engaging way to promote your campaign message and to draw attention to the lack of affordable housing in your community.

### **Real-life examples**

The protest was covered widely across news media, because of the disproportionate police violence used. After the protests, several municipalities announced they would start requiring people to live in the houses they buy, to counter slumlords (â€˜zelfwoonplichtâ€™).

**ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German housing protests:** In Berlin, 10.000 people went to the streets to demand an end to the [soaring rent prices](https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-protesters-urge-end-to-soaring-rents/a-57635183).
