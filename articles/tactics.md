**This chapter contains a list of various tactics that activists use to make change happen. Note that you do not have to choose one particular tactic. The most successful movements use a combination of tactics and allow people to contribute to the cause in their own way.**

> Start organising small, build towards something big. Radical change starts small. If you would like to learn how to become the spark that ignites the fire, also make sure to check out our [organising chapter](/organising).

## Choose your tactic

You should pick your tactics based on your [strategy](/strategy). To help you get started, we created four broad categories. Tactics may fall under multiple categories. Also make sure to read our guide on how to [choosing your tactic](/tactics/choose).

## List of tactics

### **Protests ‚úä**

Protesting is great way to attract the attention of the public, either by gathering a large crowd or by doing something out of the ordinary.

**Topics:** [March](/tactics/march) | [Flash mob](/tactics/flash-mob) | [Occupation](/tactics/occupation) | [Direct action](/tactics/direct-action) | [Civil disobedience](/tactics/civil-disobedience) | [Cultural disobedience](/tactics/cultural-disobedience) | [Human banner](/tactics/human-banner) | [Cacerolazo](/tactics/cacerolazo) | [Hunger strike](/tactics/hunger-strike) | [Banner drop](/tactics/banner-drop) | [Citizen's arrest](/tactics/citizens-arrest) | [Distributed action](/tactics/distributed-action) | [Hoax](/tactics/hoax) | [Lamentation (mourning)](https://beautifulrising.org/tool/lamentation) | Walking blockade

### **Creative üé®**

Activism can be beautiful. By using creative tactics you can make your movement stand out from the crowd.

**Topics:** [**Visual Identity**](/communication/visual-identity) | [Posters](/tactics/posters) | [Stickers](/tactics/stickers) | [Stamps](/tactics/stamps) | [Film](/tactics/film) | [Photography](/tactics/photography) | [Art](/tactics/art) | [Theatre](/tactics/theatre) | [Music](/tactics/music) | [Artistic vigil](/tactics/artistic-vigil)

### Digital üë©‚Äçüíª

There are many ways of digital activism. Some of them include sharing pictures and stories, building a network or sharing a certain hashtag, getting as many people as possible to sign a petition.

**Topics:** [Petitions](/tactics/petition) | [Hacktivism](/tactics/hacktivism)

### Informational üéì

Sometimes having a conversation is better than shouting slogans. Informational tactics are there to start a public debate about certain topics, in the hope that the outcome of the debate will lead to societal change.

**Topics:** [Education](/tactics/education) | [Door-to-door canvassing](/tactics/canvassing) | [Leafletting](/tactics/leafletting) | [Hosting a talk or debate](/tactics/talk-debate) | [Journalism](/tactics/journalism) | [Whistleblowing](/tactics/whistleblowing) | [Blogging](/tactics/blogging) | [Novels](/tactics/novels)

### Institutional üèõ

By joining existing institutions one can make change happen from within. Institutional tactics create societal change while following the rules of the existing system.

**Topics:** [Voting](/organising/frameworks/elections) | [Running for office](/tactics/running-for-office) | [Judicial](/tactics/judicial) | [Corporate](/tactics/corporate)

### Financial ü§ë

**Topics:** [Boycott](/tactics/boycot) | [Divestment](/tactics/divestment) | [Shareholder](/tactics/shareholder)

> ‚ÄúA good tactic is one that **your people enjoy**. If your people are not having a ball doing it, there is something very wrong with the tactic.‚Äù
> 
> Saul Alinsky (Rules for Radicals, p.94)

## Improve this page

### Focus

When improving this chapter, focus on the following:

-   Find a better way to organise this list of tactics
    
-   Make a default article template for how to discuss a tactic, so that every article has the same structure setup (e.g. examples, materials needed, steps to organise)
    

### Suggested new chapter organization

Goals of the chapter:

-   Helping people connect the dots between their strategy and the tactics they use (the actions you organise should
    
-   Encourage creativity and diversity in tactics (if activism is boring, it's not newsworthy)
    

Filter our recommended tactics based on the way you would like to achieve change (using a combination is recommended!):

-   üé® I want to use **creativity** (**cultural disruption)** to get attention: _useful to be visible and put things on the agenda_
    
-   ‚úä I want to use **civil disobedience (legal disruption)** to create pressure: _useful if you want to force decision makers to listen to you, to challenge those in power_
    
-   üí¨ I want to **encourage conversations** with bystanders: _useful if you want to grow and broaden your movement, if you want to change minds_
    
-   üó≥ I want to work within **governmental institutions** to create change: _useful if you want to convert public support into policy_
    
-   ‚öñÔ∏è I want to work within **legal institutions** to create change: _useful if you see an opportunity to create change by applying existing legislation_
    
-   ü§ë I want to work within **financial institutions** to create change: _useful if you see an opportunity to make decision makers listen to you through monetary incentives_
