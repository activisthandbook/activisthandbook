> **Related**: Also check out our guide on [how to organise a protest](/organising/protest).

## Types of activism

Before picking your protest tactic, you first need to decide what type of activism you would like to do. We organised our creative protest ideas into the following categories, loosely ordered from most to least rebellious:

-   **‚úä** [**Civil disobedience**](/tactics/civil-disobedience): challenging the system by breaking the law on purpose, for example using blockades, occupations or strikes.
    
-   **üõ†** [**Alternative building**](/tactics/alternative-building): envisioning a different future, for example by building community gardens, introducing alternative local currencies, and constructing off-grid homes - alse called constructive program.
    
-   **üé®** [**Cultural activism (artivism)**](/tactics/artivism): using creativity to draw attention to your cause, for example using theatre, music and brandalism.
    
-   **üíª** [**Digital activism**](/tactics/digital-activism): making use of online platforms or using hacktivism to disrupt the digital world to make a point.
    
-   **üí¨** [**Raising awareness**](/tactics/raising-awareness): Educating the public about the issues and solutions, for example using speeches, petitions, slogans, symbols and media campaigns.
    
-   **üó≥** [**Political activism**](/tactics/political-activism): acting within established political institutions to create change through policy, for example by running for office or organising succesful election campaigns.
    
-   **‚öñÔ∏è** [**Legal activism**](/tactics/legal-activism): forcing change by applying existing laws, for example through climate litigation (suing companies and governments based on environmental and human-right laws) .
    
-   **ü§ë** [**Financial activism**](/tactics/finanical-activism): using monetary pressure to create change, for example through boycotts or shareholder activism
    

## Action toolbox

Whatever your action, these practices will come in handy:

-   üöî Resisting arrest ([Going floppy](/tactics/going-floppy))
    
-   üé® Painting banners
    
-   üè≥ Creating flags
    
-   ‚òÆÔ∏è [Disabling a tank](/tactics/disable-tank)
    

## Local context

The local context across countries can impact activists trying to choose their protest tactics in various ways. For example, the level of repression, the media coverage, the public opinion, the legal framework, and the cultural norms can all influence the effectiveness and the risks of different forms of protest. Activists need to consider these factors carefully and adapt their strategies accordingly to achieve their goals.

## Q&A

### What is a protest tactic?

A tactic is a specific action or method that is used to achieve a goal or objective in the context of activism and protesting. Tactics can be diverse and creative, such as marches, sit-ins, boycotts, strikes, petitions, graffiti, banners, etc. Tactics can also be violent or nonviolent, depending on the situation and the message. The choice of tactics depends on various factors, such as the target audience, the resources available, the risks involved, the ethical principles, and the desired outcome.

### What types of tactics exist?

There are many tactics that activists use. To bring order into the chaos, we chose one particular categorisation based on search engine optimization research. In other words, we created our categories based on the terms people use to find various types of tactics on Google. However, other ways of categorising tactics are also possible. Read chapter 3 of [Civil Resistance in the 21st Century](https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Civil-Resistance-Tactics-in-the-21st-Century-Monograph.pdf?utm_source=activisthandbook.org) by ICNC for more context.

## Improve this page

### Focus

When improving this chapter, focus on the following:

-   Find a better way to organise this list of tactics
    
-   Make a default article template for how to discuss a tactic, so that every article has the same structure setup (e.g. examples, materials needed, steps to organise)
    

### Suggested new chapter organization

Goals of the chapter:

-   Helping people connect the dots between their strategy and the tactics they use (the actions you organise should
    
-   Encourage creativity and diversity in tactics (if activism is boring, it's not newsworthy)
    

Filter our recommended tactics based on the way you would like to achieve change (using a combination is recommended! Tactics may fall into multiple categories):

-   üé® I want to use **creativity** (**cultural disruption)** to get attention: _useful to be visible and put things on the agenda_
    
    -   _Suggested SEO title: not sure (possibly: "Creative protest ideas", we might also want to change the title of the chapter to "protest ideas" which is much more popular than "protest tactics")_
        
-   ‚úä I want to use **civil disobedience (legal disruption)** to create pressure: _useful if you want to force decision makers to listen to you, to challenge those in power -_
    
    -   _Suggested SEO title: 'Civil disobedience' would be a perfect title, lots of monthly searches, 'direct action' is a good second choice, but it's searched less and there's some clothing company that would be competing with us and would probably win._
        
-   üõ† I want to **build alternatives** to show a different world is possible: _useful if people cannot envision what a better world might look like, not to accept the status quo_
    
    -   _Suggested SEO title: not sure, 'alternative building' has an acceptable number of monthly searches, but we might want to look a bit further to see if there are any other terms more frequently used to describe this type of activism_
        
-   üí¨ I want to **encourage conversations** with bystanders: _useful if you want to grow and broaden your movement, if you want to change minds_
    
    -   _Suggested SEO title: raising awareness_
        
-   üó≥ I want to work within **governmental institutions** to create change: _useful if you want to convert public support into policy_
    
    -   _Suggested SEO title: not sure, 'political activism' has an acceptable number of monthly searches (downside of course is that all activism is political. On the other hand, 'politics' is commonly understood as 'governmental institutions'. We might want to look a bit further to see if there are any other terms more frequently used to describe this type of activism._
        
-   ‚öñÔ∏è I want to work within **legal institutions** to create change: _useful if you see an opportunity to create change by applying existing legislation_
    
    -   _Suggested SEO title: legal activism?_
        
-   ü§ë I want to work within **financial institutions** to create change: _useful if you see an opportunity to make decision makers listen to you through monetary incentives_
    
    -   _Suggested SEO title: financial activism?_
        

And a section called 'action toolbox', that covers tools you can use with many different tactics. For example:

-   Artist tools: Painting banners, paper mache,
    
-   Digital tools: Hacktivism
    
-   Etc.
