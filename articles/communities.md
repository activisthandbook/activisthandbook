While writing Activist Handbook, we realised that each activist community also needs their own guides that apply to their specific cause. That is why we allow these communities to add your own manuals on our website.

> **Let's work together!** Activist Handbook is a collaborative project by activists all over the globe. We would love to [**partner up**](/partner) with your organisation or movement.

## List of communities

Many movements advocate causes that are interconnected with other issues. The categorisation pages below serve as a way to make it easier for website visitors to find the community they are looking for. Various movements are also added to multiple category pages. A movement that is added to one category, does not mean they do not care about other issues as well.

Categorised by cause, in alphabetic order:

-   [**Animal rights**](animal-rights)
-   [**Anti-racism**](anti-racism): Originating from the anti-colonial movement, these people demand equality for all people, regardless of their skin color. Recently, the cause has gained new attention through the black lives matter movement.
