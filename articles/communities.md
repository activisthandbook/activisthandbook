While writing Activist Handbook, we realised that each activist community also needs their own guides that apply to their specific cause. That is why we allow these communities to add your own manuals on our website.

**Let's work together!** Activist Handbook is a collaborative project by activists all over the globe. We would love to [**partner up**](/partner) with your organisation or movement.

## List of communities

Many movements advocate causes that are interconnected with other issues. The categorisation pages below serve as a way to make it easier for website visitors to find the community they are looking for. Various movements are also added to multiple category pages. A movement that is added to one category, does not mean they do not care about other issues as well.

Categorised by cause, in alphabetic order:

-   [**Animal rights**](/communities/animal-rights)
    
-   [**Anti-racism**](/communities/anti-racism): Originating from the anti-colonial movement, these people demand equality for all people, regardless of their skin color. Recently, the cause has gained new attention through the black lives matter movement.
    
-   [**Anti-fascism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fascism): “Anti-fascism is a political movement in opposition to fascist ideologies, groups and individuals.” - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fascism)

All over the globe movements such as Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, Youth for Climate and many more have gained significant popularity.
    
-   [**Feminism**](/communities/feminism): “Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view, and that women are treated unjustly within those societies. Efforts to change that include fighting against gender stereotypes and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women that are equal to those for men.” - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism)
    
-   [**Queer/LGBTQ+**](/communities/queer): In many countries, the queer movement has successfully advocated acceptance and equal rights for people regardless of their sex, gender and sexual orientation.
    
-   [**Inequality**](/communities/inequality): Movements included in this category address the issue of social, economic, and political inequality. This category is a bit broad, but we included it nevertheless as the movements included address a broad variety of inequality-forms themselves as well. A notable examples is the Occupy movement.
