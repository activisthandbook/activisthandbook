## We are working with data & revolutionary technologies

We don’t just write guides. Activist Handbook uses a **data-driven approach** and develops **digital tools** to empower change-makers.

### Large numbers, big impact

- **🔍 1K+ search queries analysed:** We know what challenges activists face most, and what words they type into Google to find help. With this SEO data, we can write the guides that activists actually need and make sure our platform is found by the people looking for it.
- **📚 4.7K resources:** We did not write our 450+ guides from scratch. Instead, we brought together material from experienced campaigned around the globe and organised all of it in into one single comprehensive handbook.
- **🔥 4K+ activist trained every month:** Our number of volunteers can be counted on one hand and budget is €0. Yet, we manage to train thousands of activists every single month. Every person counts, and the more activists use and contribute to our wiki platform, the better it gets. Share your knowledge with others [right now](https://edit.activisthandbook.org/new)!

### A unique digital toolset

- **🧑‍💻 We develop our own digital tools:** If we need it, we build it. We bring together our experience with campaigning and web development.
- **💡 We empower activists with AI:** Writing whole articles seems daunting for anyone, but you will never have to worry about where to start, as we will help you with AI text generation. You can also easily generate pictures to accompany your guide. Inspiring others is an art, and you are the artist!
- **⚡️ We prioritise speed & accessibility:** Everyone should be able to use Activist Handbook, no matter if you are on a slow or expensive data plan. So we put in the work to make that possible, and it shows! For example, [our platform](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/new.activisthandbook.org/14N3WvPa/) loads 8x faster and uses 87% less data than the [Beautiful Trouble](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/beautifultrouble.org/AR67fKWP/) website (Tested 25th of Dec 2022).
