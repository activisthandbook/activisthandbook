This workshop lets campaigners brainstorm individually using visuals, then discuss together to find common ground and develop their group's strategy.

This tool gives everyone chance to think about their vision for the group before being influenced by other people's ideas. It is also good for people who like visual and tactile activities.

**Ask:** â€˜What do you want this group to achieve?' or 'What will it look like in three years time if this group is successful?'

Provide coloured pens, bits of fabric, magazines with nice pictures and text, scissors, glue. Take 15-20 minutes to each think on your own, and represent your answer to the question as a picture, collage, flow-chart, mind-map or any other visual.

Then each person in turn explains their picture and what they were trying to put across. When everyone has had their turn ask yourselves: 'What are the similarities?' 'What are the differences?' 'Is there anything we need to explore further before deciding together on our aims?'

If there are a lot of you, this stage can be done in small groups, then feed back key points to the main group.
