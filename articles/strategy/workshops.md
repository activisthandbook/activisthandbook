On this page, we list all strategy workshops. Use these instructions to host your own sessions and develop a strategy with your fellow change-makers.

There are over 20 workshop sessions you can use to develop your campaign strategy, but you likely have limited time. Try to find the workshops that best fit your current needs. Some workshops have similar outcomes, but just use different methods of getting there.

> **We need your help to improve these workshop templates!** If you try one of them out with your group, make sure to reflect afterwards, and share your findings by improving these guides.

## Facilitating

Before diving into all the workshops you can use to develop your strategy: make sure you know [**how to facilitate**](/organising/facilitating)!

A facilitator plays a vital role in helping activist groups craft campaign strategies. They foster a safe and inclusive space by ensuring everyone feels valued and empowered to participate, while respectfully managing discussions and conflicts. This allows diverse perspectives and solutions to flourish.

The facilitator guides the strategic process by setting agendas, introducing facilitation tools, and ensuring clear communication through summarising and documenting key points. They guide the group process and support them in reaching their own informed decisions. Overall, the facilitator acts as a catalyst for collaborative and effective campaign strategy development.
