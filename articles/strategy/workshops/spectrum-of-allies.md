This tool helps you understand who supports your cause, who opposes it. By analysing these groups, you can shift neutral or passive individuals towards becoming active allies.

## Summary

This tool, called the ‚Äòspectrum of support‚Äô‚Äô, helps campaigners think through who they are trying to reach:

-   Active participants
    
-   Passive supporters
    
-   Neutral
    
-   Passive opponents
    
-   Active opponents
    

The spectrum splits up the general public according to their opinion and level of activity on your campaign goals. The idea is that encouraging any segment of people to move to the left has a positive impact on your goal. For example, if passive opponents start to see different perspectives on the issue, then active opponents become isolated.

Use this tool as a simple visual back-up to explore the impact of focusing on different sets of people. Most campaigns need to focus on supporting passive supporters to become active participants. Beyond that, you might just prioritise one segment. For example, at the start of a campaign, you might work on raising awareness of the issues, so that currently neutral people become passive supporters.

## Introduction

In this guide, we explain how to use the 'Spectrum of Allies', also called 'Spectrum of Support' tool.

Movements seldom win by overpowering the opposition; they win by shifting support out from under it. Use a spectrum-of-allies analysis to identify the social groups (students, workers) that are affected by your issue, and locate those groups along a spectrum, from active opposition to active allies, so you can focus your efforts on shifting those groups closer to your position. Identifying specific stakeholders (e.g. not just students, but students at public colleges; not just workers, but domestic workers) can help you identify the most effective ways of moving different social groups closer to your position, in order to win your campaign.

> In the end we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.- Martin Luther King, Jr.

When mapping out your campaign, it is useful to look at society as a collection of specific communities, blocs, or networks, some of which are institutions (unions, churches, schools), others of which are less visible or cohesive, like youth subcultures or demographic groupings. The more precisely you can identify stakeholders and impacted communities, the better you can prepare to persuade those groups or individuals to move closer to your position. You can then weigh the relative costs and benefits of focusing on different blocs.

Evaluating your spectrum of allies can help you avoid some common pitfalls. Some activist groups, for instance, only concern themselves with their active allies, which runs the risk of ‚Äúpreaching to the choir‚Äù ‚Äî building marginal subcultures that are incomprehensible to everyone else, while ignoring the people you actually need to convince. Others behave as if everyone who disagrees with their position is an active opponent, playing out the ‚Äústory of the righteous few,‚Äù acting as if the whole world is against them. Yet others take a ‚Äúspeak truth to power‚Äù approach, figuring that through moral appeal or force of logical argument, they can somehow win over their most entrenched active opponents. All three of these extreme approaches virtually guarantee failure.

Movements and campaigns are won not by overpowering one‚Äôs active opposition, but by shifting each group one notch around the spectrum (passive allies into active allies, neutrals into passive allies, and passive opponents into neutrals), thereby increasing people power in favour of change and weakening your opposition.

> Movements win not by overpowering their active opposition, but by shifting the support out from under it.

For example, in 1964 in the U.S., the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a major driver of the African-American civil rights movement in the racially segregated South, realized that in order to win desegregation and voting rights for African Americans, they needed to make active allies of sympathetic white northerners. Many students in the North were sympathetic, but had no entry point into the movement. They didn‚Äôt need to be educated or convinced, they needed an invitation to enter the struggle. (Or in the spectrum-of-allies schema, they needed to be moved from passive allies into active allies.) Moreover, these white students had extended communities of white families and friends who were not directly impacted by the struggles of African-American southerners. As the struggle escalated, these groups could be shifted from neutral to passive allies or even active allies.

Based on this analysis, the SNCC made a strategic decision to focus on reaching neutral white communities in the North by engaging sympathetic white students in their Freedom Summer program. Busloads of students travelled to the South to assist with voter registration, and many were deeply radicalized in the process. They witnessed lynchings, violent police abuse, and angry white mobs, all a response to black Southerners simply trying to exercise their right to vote.

Many wrote letters home to their parents, who suddenly had a personal connection to the struggle. This triggered another desired shift: Their families became passive allies, often bringing their workplaces and social networks with them. The students, meanwhile, returned to school in the fall as active allies, and proceeded to organize their campuses ‚Äî more shifts in the direction of civil rights. The result: a profound transformation of the political landscape.

This cascading shift of support wasn‚Äôt spontaneous; it was part of a deliberate movement strategy that, to this day, carries profound lessons for other movements.

## How to use

Use this tool to identify the constituencies that could be moved one notch along the spectrum, as well as to assess the relative costs of reaching, educating, or mobilizing each of these constituencies. Do not use this tool to identify your arch enemies and go after them ‚Äî it‚Äôs the people in the middle you‚Äôll most often want to focus on. The groupings or individuals you identify should be as specific as possible: not just unions, for instance, but specific unions. The more specific you can be, the better this tool will serve you.

Here‚Äôs how to do a spectrum-of-allies analysis:

#### 1\. Set up a ‚Äúhalf-pie‚Äù drawing

Label the entire drawing with the name of the specific movement or campaign you are discussing, and put yourself on the left side, with your opposition on the right side.

#### 2\. Divide the half-pie into five slices:

-   _active allies_, or people who agree with you and are fighting alongside you;
    
-   _passive allies_, or people who agree with you but aren‚Äôt (yet) doing anything about it;
    
-   _neutrals_, or the unengaged and uninformed;
    
-   _passive opposition_, or people who disagree with you but aren‚Äôt actively trying to stop you; and
    
-   _active opposition_, or people who not only disagree with you, but are actively organizing against you.
    

In the appropriate wedges, place different constituencies, organizations, or individuals. Spend a significant amount of time brainstorming the groups and individuals that belong in each of the sections. Be specific: list them with as many identifying characteristics as possible. And make sure to cover every wedge; neglecting sections will limit your strategic planning and your potential effectiveness.

#### 3\. Step back and see if you‚Äôre being specific enough

For every group or bloc you listed in the diagram, ask yourself whether you could be more specific ‚Äî are there more adjectives or qualifiers you could add to give more definition to the description? You might be tempted to say ‚Äúmothers,‚Äù but the reality might be that ‚Äúwealthy mothers who live in gated communities‚Äù might belong in one wedge, and ‚Äúmothers who work as market vendors‚Äù would belong in another. The more specific you can be, the better this tool will serve you.

#### 4\. Identify what else you need to know.

When you come up against the limits of your knowledge, make sure to start a list of follow-up questions ‚Äî and commit to doing the research you‚Äôll need to get the answers.

## Combine with other tools

The spectrum of allies can also work well in combination with other methodologies:

-   First, use¬†[pillars of power](https://beautifulrising.org/tool/pillars-of-power)¬†to map out the biggest forces at play.
    
-   Combine with a¬†[SWOT matrix](https://beautifulrising.org/tool/swot-matrix) in order to help you identify all key constituencies.
    
-   Follow up with points of intervention¬†in order to identify tactics and actions to engage the key constituencies you‚Äôve identified.

## Potential risks

Watch out for very broad or generic identification of the blocs/groups in the pie chart. Without enough precision this tool won‚Äôt help you identify specific communication tactics for reaching particular groups. Nor will you be able to get an accurate read on the true resource costs of reaching those groups.
