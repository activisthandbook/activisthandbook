This workshop helps activists focus on existing successes to boost morale, optimism, and creativity for future change within their group.

This is a whole approach to making change within a group, campaign or project which focuses on what is already working well. We cannot do it full justice here, but we have included it because it is a powerful way of helping people see what they are achieving. This in turn can help people approach the future with optimism and creativity. Loss of morale is one of the biggest threats to voluntary campaign groups, so it makes sense to integrate ways of boosting your confidence into your strategy process.

Start by asking questions like: Whatâ€™s going well? What do we enjoy? What motivates us? In what ways are we effectively reaching people? What positive impacts are we having? Where would we like to get to?

Bridge from here into questions like: What can we build on and develop? How could we enjoy the campaign even more? How can we increase our positive impacts?
