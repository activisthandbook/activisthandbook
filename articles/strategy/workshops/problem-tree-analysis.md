This workshop equips activists with a visual "problem tree" tool to analyze root causes and consequences, guiding their campaign strategy development.

## **Objective**

This exercise is used to analyse the root causes of a problem and to identify the primary consequences. The tree provides a visual structure for the analysis.

## **Time**

1-2 hours

## **How itâ€™s done**

This activity is best handled in small groups so that each person in the group has an opportunity to participate. If time makes this impossible, a large group can be divided into two groups, with the first group working on causes and the second group examining consequences.

If you are working on more than one problem, assign each group a different problem. Take one problem and go through the process once together before dividing into groups.

### **Step One**

Explain the problem tree. Point out the different parts of the tree and what each represents:

-   Roots = Root Causes of the Problem
    
-   Trunk=the Problem
    
-   Branches = Consequences of the Problem
    

### **Step Two**

Ask a participant to draw a tree on flipchart paper. Write the problem on the trunk of the tree. Ask all participants to list the causes of the problem. If possible, let each participant who suggests a cause write it on a card and tape it to the roots of the problem tree. If this is too time-consuming, the facilitator can write what the participants say on the tree. Encourage people to explore social, economic, and political causes including attitudes, behavior, and other factors

### **Step Three**

Repeat the same process with the consequences.

## **Discussion**

-   First ask questions about the problem itself, then follow up with questions about the solutions.
    
-   What are the most serious consequences?
    
-   Which causes will be easier to address? More difficult to address? Why
    
-   Which causes and consequences can the government help address? Where can international agencies help? (etc) What can people do?
