## Introduction

A campaign strategy is a **plan or roadmap** **that helps you achieve your goal** of creating some form of change in the world.

This guide is for people who have a strong drive to bring about change by starting a new initiative, but do not know where to begin. Of course, you can also bring about change by joining an existing initiative. However, many projects and organisations actually do not have a good strategy! If you are joining an existing initiative, this guide will help you evaluate and improve their strategy.

In this guide, we discuss the **basic elements** of a campaign strategy:

1.  **üí° Vision**
    
2.  üåê **Stakeholders**
    
3.  **üéØ Goals**
    
4.  **‚úÖ Objectives**
    
5.  üì¢ **Tactics**
    
6.  **üìä Evaluation**
    

These basic strategy elements have been developed by campaigners with years of experience. By following this guide you will avoid common pitfalls that many activists before you had to figure out on their own.

You might feel like these strategy concepts feel a bit abstract. That is why we have provided **examples** below to help you understand.

Once you feel you understand the basic elements, we encourage you to check out our more **in-depth guides** that we linked below as well. They include practical workshops to help you write your own campaign strategy. For example, if you want to know what stakeholders are important in your campaign, we have a workshop called "Spectrum of Allies" that will help you find them.

So, what are you waiting for? Read on!

## Prerequisites

Before you can start developing a campaign strategy you need:

-   **People to work together with:** You cannot develop a good campaign strategy alone. Check out our [organising chapter](/organising) for information on how to get together with other people.
    
-   **Time**: If you are in the heat of the moment, you are probably not writing campaign strategy plans. You need some time to analyse your context, reflect, and come up well-thought-out plans. That does not mean you should not write a strategy if you are busy! Activists are always busy. You need to _make_ time, because doing activism without a strategy is useless.
    

## Campaign strategy elements

### **1\. Vision üí°**

Your [**vision**](/strategy/vision) is your analysis of the root problem and your big ideas on how to make the world a better place.

> **_Example_**_: You might argue that the climate crisis is caused by a political system that gives more power to people with lots of money. However, you still believe there is the possibility_ of _changing this unfair system, by getting together enough people. You want to build a new political system that gives a voice to everyone, especially those impacted most by the climate crisis._

### 2\. Stakeholders üåê

[**Stakeholders**](/strategy/stakeholders) are all the individuals, groups of people and organisations that are relevant to your movement.

> **_Example:_** _You might want to analyse who are the stakeholders for your climate justice campaign. First of all, there are the people who are impacted by the climate crisis. Secondly, you have a list of allies, such as other environmental organisations. Thirdly, you have opponents because they profit from the current system, such as fossil fuel companies and politicians that get funded by them. Finally, you have targets, such as political parties that usually get a lot of votes from people who care about the climate._

### 3\. Goals üéØ

Your [**goals**](/strategy/goals) are the concrete things that you want to achieve with your movement. Your goals define the scope of what your movement focuses on, within your broader vision.

> **_Example:_** _Your movement has the goal of letting people decide about the future of our planet, instead of the lobbyists of fossil fuel companies._ _You want to do so by demanding from your politicians to organise a citizens assembly that has the power to implement new environmental policies._

### 4\. Objectives ‚úÖ

The best way of understanding [**objectives**](/strategy/objectives) without confusing them with goals is to identify them as specific tasks that explain exactly how the goals are achieved. Objectives are the most specific elements of strategies and are mostly used to decide on action plans. Ideally, they are SMART:

-   Specific and Strategic
    
-   Measurable
    
-   Achievable
    
-   Realistic
    
-   Time bound.
    

> **_Example_**_: You want your national parliament to organise a citizens assembly about the climate crisis. As a first step, you set the following objective: you want all major news media to write about your idea of a citizens assembly in the coming month because you think this will help create public support._

### 5\. Tactics üì¢

[**Tactics**](/tactics) are something we have an entire chapter about. They are, in a nutshell, concrete series of actions that we plan and execute in order to meet our strategic goals. Depending on your strategies some tactics might be more relevant than others. Different tactics attract people with different values and have varying degrees of success. Make sure not to confuse tactics and values. _Solidarity_ or _youth participation_ are not tactics, those are values that tactics such as cooperatives or student parliaments might help strengthen.

> **_Example:_** _You want all major news media to write about your idea of a citizens assembly. To achieve that, you want to use the tactic of putting up posters. Your plan is to distribute 5.000 large posters throughout the country with a controversial statement on it, in the hope of getting lots of media attention._

### 6\. Evaluation üìä

The [**evaluation**](/strategy/evaluation) is important to reflect on what you are doing and determine whether it is effective. We want to have reliable ways of evaluating our own success and that can help us see our weak spots so we can improve them. Metrics play a very important role in this type of measurement.

> **_Example:_** _Putting up posters was only your first step in getting closer to a citizens assembly. You want to know if using posters as a means to get media attention worked: How many news media wrote about your action? Do you now have enough public support so you can move on to the next phase in your campaign strategy, or do you still have some work to do there first?_

## Common challenges

### Balancing urgency and strategy

Activists are often driven by deep passion and urgency about their cause. This sense of urgency can sometimes lead to hastily planned strategies that may not be as effective in the long run.

### Conflict within the group

Differences in opinion on campaign strategies can lead to internal conflicts within the activist group. This can result in time and energy spent on dealing with internal issues rather than focusing on the campaign itself.

### Goal setting

Defining clear, achievable goals can be difficult, especially in movements that aim for significant systemic change. Without clear goals, it can be hard to maintain motivation or measure progress.

## Strategy is not everything

Organising a successful campaign is about more than just having a good strategy. We recommend you to read our guide on [how to organise a campaign](/organising/campaign) to learn about all other aspects, such as communicating your message, taking care of the wellbeing of your volunteers, your legal rights, and much more.
