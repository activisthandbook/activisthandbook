## What is power mapping?

Power mapping is a strategic planning tool used by activists and organizers to identify and analyze the key stakeholders, influencers, and decision-makers who have the power to impact a particular issue or campaign. It helps in understanding the relationships, interests, and influence dynamics among these stakeholders, allowing activists to develop more effective strategies and tactics to achieve their goals.

## How to create a power map?

In a power map, individuals or organizations are typically represented as nodes or points on a grid, with lines connecting them to show relationships or influence channels. The position of each node on the map can represent its level of power or influence, while other factors like color or size can be used to indicate additional characteristics, such as their stance on the issue at hand or their potential to be influenced.

Power mapping can be an invaluable tool for activists as it helps them to:

1.  **Identify key players**: Understand who holds power, makes decisions, and influences outcomes related to the issue they are working on.
    
2.  **Assess alliances and opposition**: Identify potential allies, opponents, and neutral parties to better focus their outreach and coalition-building efforts.
    
3.  **Develop targeted strategies**: By understanding the power dynamics and relationships among stakeholders, activists can create more effective strategies for engaging and influencing these actors.
    
4.  **Prioritize resources and efforts**: Activists can use power mapping to allocate their time and resources more efficiently, focusing on high-impact targets and opportunities for change.
    
5.  **Monitor progress**: As campaigns and initiatives evolve, updating a power map can help activists track shifts in power dynamics and relationships, allowing them to adapt their strategies accordingly.
    

Overall, power mapping is a valuable tool for understanding complex systems and power structures, enabling activists and change-makers to develop more effective strategies for achieving their goals.
