Here you will find articles and resources to help you write a strategy for your movement. We have added step-by-step guides for organising workshop sessions to start writing a strategy together with fellow rebels.

> **Article quality**: ⭐️⭐️ (2/5)

## Methods for developing a strategy

-   [**Theory of Change (ToC)**](/theory/change)**:** A methodology used for strategy and evaluation. The model of ToC starts by defining a long-term goal and then works backwards by identifying preconditions needed to achieve this goal.
    

## **Templates & workgroup guides**

There is no “one right way” to capture and communicate all the elements of strategy. Some organisations have a preference for simple one-page tables. Others use longly narrative formats or complex documents that extend to 20 pages or more. Some templates we’ve seen used effectively are:

-   [**tCA strategy chart**](https://thechangeagency.org/tca-strategy-chart/): This chart shows the anatomy of a campaign strategy. It provides a compact overview of different elements of strategizing and suggestions for processes your group can use to develop them.
    
-   [**tCA campaign strategy template**](https://thechangeagency.org/tca-campaign-strategy-template/): a template incorporating elements of strategy and suggested processes to develop each element with members of your group
    
-   [**tCA Basic strategy grid**](https://thechangeagency.org/basic-strategy-grid/): An adapted version of the Midwest Academy’s community organising grid, this simple table provides one way of developing and integrating key pieces of a strategy in a logical sequence.
    
-   [**tCA Strategic planning template**](https://thechangeagency.org/strategic-planning-template-2/): This format has been used by medium-sized environment groups in their annual planning cycle. A simple table requiring vision, objectives, resources and performance indicators. The table is also useful for evaluation purposes.
