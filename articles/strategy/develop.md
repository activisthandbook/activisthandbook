In this guide, we explain how to write a strategy plan for your campaign or organisation. First, we list various situations that might be similar to the one you are in. Secondly, we provide a few workshop guides that you can use as a template for your strategy brainstorm.

## What is your situation?

### I am alone and want to bring about change

You want to change something, but you do not know exactly where to get started. You might feel discouraged, because you feel alone in your fight.

üëâ **_Our advice_**_: Get together with a few other people first. While a strategy can help you understand what actions to take, a strategy is best developed together with others._

### Our group is just starting out: no strategy

You have come together with a few others. You might just have started a new campaign or organisation, and you do not have any strategy yet. You have seen some injustice, and you want to do something about it. You might even have taken some action: for example, you may have started collecting signatures for a petition, organised a protest or created a social media account to 'spread awareness'. But you have not really thought about how your actions are going to help you achieve your goals.

üëâ **_Our advice_**_: You have momentum right now, make use of it quickly! Without a strategy, your actions are likely not going to help you achieve your goals. This will lead to disappointment, and people will leave. A strategy does not guarantee success, but it will turn any failures into a learning process:_

-   _Get together with everyone who wants to contribute and have a brainstorm to develop a strategy together. Make sure to split up into small groups (max 8 people) based on common interests._
    
-   _You do not have to come to consensus as a whole group. You might find that one group wants to take a particular approach, and another has a different strategy in mind. That is fine! Think about how your different approaches can strengthen each other, and each try to make your own strategy work._
    

### Our organisation has a strategy, but we are not making impact

Your organisation has matured. You might have written very extensive strategic plans. But if you look out there in the real world, you do not see any tangible change. You might feel like you are putting more effort into maintaining the organisation than into achieving the goals that the organisation exists for in the first place. You might be very successful in some terms: getting donors, having people signing petitions, etc. But these 'successes' do not seem to translate into a real-world difference.

üëâ **_Our advice_**_: Your reflection process is likely not working. Take a step back and reserve time to evaluate and strategise:_

-   _Determine what things help you get closer to your goals, and which things just help your organisation stay around. There is no point in maintaining an organisation that does not make impact._
    

-   _While evaluating, you might find that you do not have the data to determine if you are making progress. In that case, determine what data you could start collecting._
    
-   _You might find that you are not actually doing the things you wrote down in your strategic plans. In that case, try to make your strategy more concrete. What are your objectives and tactics? What items should you put on your to-do list? Give to-do's that directly contribute to achieving your objectives priority above anything else. Things that are urgent are not necessarily important._
    

### Disagreement about strategy

You might have a strategy, but you or other people might not agree with it. You might not agree on goals or tactics to achieve those goals. People are getting frustrated, because disagreements make collaboration difficult.

üëâ **_Our advice:_** _If you want to be effective as an organisation, you need consensus on your strategy. In other words: everyone needs to agree on the broad lines why your organisation exists and what type of actions you organise to make impact._

-   _As a first step, get everyone together to reflect on your strategy and take lots of time. You do not want to put time pressure on this!_ [_Good facilitation of the meeting_](/organising/facilitating) _is absolutely essential, otherwise you risk unproductive and harmful fights. Have a dialogue, not a discussion._
    

-   _You might not get everyone on the same page. Ask yourselves: what is it that binds us together? Can we form different subgroups that each do their own thing, but strengthen each other as a whole? If there is not enough to bind you together as a single organisation, it might be better to split up. Do not let conflict be the reason for you to split up: good facilitation can address that. But it is completely fine to have fundamental disagreements on goals and tactics (in which case you should not be one organisation)._
    

## **Templates & workgroup guides**

There is no ‚Äúone right way‚Äù to capture and communicate all the elements of strategy. Some organisations have a preference for simple one-page tables. Others use longly narrative formats or complex documents that extend to 20 pages or more. Some templates we‚Äôve seen used effectively are:

-   [**Strategy chart**](https://thechangeagency.org/tca-strategy-chart/): This chart shows the anatomy of a campaign strategy. It provides a compact overview of different elements of strategizing and suggestions for processes your group can use to develop them.
    
-   [**Campaign strategy template**](https://thechangeagency.org/tca-campaign-strategy-template/): a template incorporating elements of strategy and suggested processes to develop each element with members of your group
    
-   [**Basic strategy grid**](https://thechangeagency.org/basic-strategy-grid/): An adapted version of the Midwest Academy‚Äôs community organising grid, this simple table provides one way of developing and integrating key pieces of a strategy in a logical sequence.
    
-   [**Strategic planning template**](https://thechangeagency.org/strategic-planning-template-2/): This format has been used by medium-sized environment groups in their annual planning cycle. A simple table requiring vision, objectives, resources and performance indicators. The table is also useful for evaluation purposes.

## Methods for developing a strategy

-   [**Theory of Change (ToC)**](/theory/change)**:** A methodology used for strategy and evaluation. The model of ToC starts by defining a long-term goal and then works backwards by identifying preconditions needed to achieve this goal.
