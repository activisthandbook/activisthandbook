**Activism can be simply explained as the efforts of a person or group of people to promote or intervene in a social, political, economic or environmental reform with the desire to make changes in society toward a perceived greater good.**

### **Activism**

Activism may seem like an easy task where people just come together to organize a protest in hopes to make an impact. However, there is more to activism; it requires a lot of research , facts and reliable sources. And this is because to make changes, you have to be knowledgeable on whatever cause you follow.

Many become activists try to make impact in the world and end up going the wrong way about it. Their peaceful protests turn into riots and the exhibition of violent behaviour because their requests to make changes may not be necessarily answered.

True activism requires patience and practical strategies to make an impact. That is why there is a need for Wikipedia for activists. So anyone can be guided in the most appropriate way to ensure peaceful protests and meetings.

### **The Need for Activism**

1.  To combat helplessness and hopelessness
2.  To create awareness and influence social change
3.  To improve safety/security and well-being
4.  To end social challenges such as dictatorship, poverty etc.
5.  To provide support to our community, country

“Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions, and utilise all events of the period for your purpose.” (p.128)
