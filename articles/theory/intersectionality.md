**This guide will provide activists with an overview of how to think about and apply intersectionality in their work.**

## What is intersectionality?

Intersectionality is a term that is used to describe the ways in which different types of discrimination interact with one another. It is often used to refer to the ways in which race, gender, and class intersect with one another.

The concept of intersectionality was first coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in the late 1980s. Crenshaw was a black feminist scholar who was concerned with the ways in which black women were being left out of both feminist and anti-racist movements.

Since then, intersectionality has become an important part of social justice work. It is now widely recognized that different forms of oppression do not operate independently of one another, but rather, they intersect and overlap in complex ways.
