The following organisations are not active any more, but we have kept them here for archiving purposes:

## Evaluation criteria

To make it easier to find the training organisation you are looking for, we evaluate all of them through the following criteria. There are many types of training organisations. The one is not better than the other, just make sure to find the one that fits your specific needs:

-   **Geography & language**: Progressive activist trainers are often internationally oriented, so they like to work together with change-makers across borders. However, this does not mean that these training organisations are always knowledgeable about local contexts. We especially see organisations from the Global South claiming they offer their services globally, while not investing in recruiting local trainers cross borders.
    
-   **Topics of expertise:** While many training organisations are quite flexible and can offer any training on demand, they each have things they are especially knowledgeable about.
    
-   **Format of training**: Some organisations offer one-off trainings for the duration of one evening, others offer month long courses. Another thing we evaluate is the degree to which support is personalised: some provide one-on-one personalised consultancy services, while others take a more scalable approach.
    
-   **Price:** Often, training organisations for activists offer some sort of flexible payment model. Large nonprofits pay more than small grassroots groups. Sometimes they even offer their time for free.
    
-   **Size**: Some training organisations are just two or three activists who come together in the weekends to share their knowledge with other change-makers. Other training organisations have more capacity.
    

In addition, we have collected the following information about these training organisations:

-   **Contact information:** Website, social media, email address, phone number, contact form (only use publicly accessible information).
    
-   **Resources**: Some organisations also offer online training resources.
    

### Freelancers

**Respect the privacy of individual activists**: Only add freelance activist trainers to this page if they have a publicly accessible website. Only share publicly available information on Activist Handbook.

## About this page

In a world where it's becoming increasingly difficult to trust the government to look out for our best interests, more and more people are turning to activism to make a difference. But being an effective activist takes more than just passion‚Äîit takes training and practice.

Luckily, there are plenty of organisations out there that can help would-be activists learn the ropes. From environmental groups to human rights organisations, there's a training ground for every type of activist. So if you're feeling called to make a difference in the world, don't be discouraged‚Äîthere are plenty of organisations out there that can help you get started, which we have listed above.

## Q&A

### Why should activists train?

There are many reasons why activists might choose to train themselves. For example, they may want to learn new skills to be more effective in their work, or they may want to gain a better understanding of the issues they are fighting for. Training can also help activists to build confidence.

Some ways that workshops can help movements and nonprofit organisations are by providing a space to exchange knowledge and experiences, to meet other activists working on similar issues, and to plan and strategise together. Workshops can also help activist movements to learn new tools and techniques to further their work.

### What can I get training for?

Activists could get training in a variety of topics, including but not limited to: community organizing, [fundraising](/organising/finance), event planning, media relations, [public speaking](/communication/public-speaking), and writing.

Experienced campaigners organise workshops for your organisation or help facilitate. They can help you to answer questions like these: how to run a successful campaign, how to use social media for campaigning, [how to door-knock or canvass](/tactics/canvassing) for a campaign, how to plan and execute a campaign event, and how to deal with media attention during a campaign. Check out the list above with all organisations that provide these trainings.

### Where do I find courses about activism?

At most universities, courses about activism are quite theoretical. Activist Handbook takes a different approach: we provide practical guides to teach you how to make a social impact. On this page, we have listed organisations around the globe that offer training and courses about change-making. Sometimes, the best way to learn more about effective advocacy is to get personalised support from experienced campaigners. We highly recommend you to reach out to

## **How to improve**

Do you know an organisation that provides trainings for activists? Add it to the list! This article overrepresents organisations in the Global North. We encourage you to look for training collectives in the Global South and add them to this page.

> Please only add organisations to the ‚Äòinternational‚Äô list, if they truly operate internationally. If they do not have trainers in multiple countries, do not add them to the international section.
