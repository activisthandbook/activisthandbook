## About this page

In a world where it's becoming increasingly difficult to trust the government to look out for our best interests, more and more people are turning to activism to make a difference. But being an effective activist takes more than just passion‚Äîit takes training and practice.

Luckily, there are plenty of organisations out there that can help would-be activists learn the ropes. From environmental groups to human rights organisations, there's a training ground for every type of activist. So if you're feeling called to make a difference in the world, don't be discouraged‚Äîthere are plenty of organisations out there that can help you get started, which we have listed above.

## Q&A

### Why should activists train?

There are many reasons why activists might choose to train themselves. For example, they may want to learn new skills to be more effective in their work, or they may want to gain a better understanding of the issues they are fighting for. Training can also help activists to build confidence.

Some ways that workshops can help movements and nonprofit organisations are by providing a space to exchange knowledge and experiences, to meet other activists working on similar issues, and to plan and strategise together. Workshops can also help activist movements to learn new tools and techniques to further their work.

### What can I get training for?

Activists could get training in a variety of topics, including but not limited to: community organizing, [fundraising](/organising/finance), event planning, media relations, [public speaking](/communication/public-speaking), and writing.

Experienced campaigners organise workshops for your organisation or help facilitate. They can help you to answer questions like these: how to run a successful campaign, how to use social media for campaigning, [how to door-knock or canvass](/tactics/canvassing) for a campaign, how to plan and execute a campaign event, and how to deal with media attention during a campaign. Check out the list above with all organisations that provide these trainings.

### Where do I find courses about activism?

At most universities, courses about activism are quite theoretical. Activist Handbook takes a different approach: we provide practical guides to teach you how to make a social impact. On this page, we have listed organisations around the globe that offer training and courses about change-making. Sometimes, the best way to learn more about effective advocacy is to get personalised support from experienced campaigners. We highly recommend you to reach out to
