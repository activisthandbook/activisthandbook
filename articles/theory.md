We discuss terms that are frequently used in the context of change-making and investigate their meaning:

-   [Democracy](/theory/democracy)

### Focus

When improving this page, focus on the following:

-   Find a way to structure this chapter
    
-   Discuss â€˜theory of change' in general, and our perspective on it. We already have an article on [theory of change](/theory/change), which should be integrated with this chapter.
    

### Questions activist may have

-   What do theoretical concepts such as participatory democracy, peer to peer education etc mean?
    
-   How do activists understand justice and equality?
