Ultima Generazione is an Italian campaign of nonviolent civil disobedience that was born in 2021. Its main goal is to stop public subsidies to fossil fuels, which they consider as a major cause of the ecological and climatic collapse that threatens the future of humanity.

Ultima Generazione organizes various actions of disruption and protest throughout Italy, such as blocking traffic, painting statues, or gluing themselves to fountains. They also hold presentation events, public assemblies, and online meetings to mobilize citizens who share their concerns and values. Ultima Generazione claims to follow the principle of nonviolence as a strategic choice, based on the evidence that nonviolent protests have a higher chance of achieving their goals. They also make simple and concrete requests that are easy to accept by the government, hoping to obtain greater results than their initial demands.

## Actions

-   In July 2022, members of the group glued themselves to a Botticelli painting at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.
    
-   In August 2022, members of the group chained themselves to a chapel banister at the Vatican Museums.
    
-   In April 2023, they poured black paint into the Fontana della Barcaccia fountain at the foot of the Spanish Steps.
    

## Meaning and translation

'Ultima Generazione' means 'the last generation' in Italian. The name Ultima Generazione was chosen to represent the last generation that can still do something to prevent climate change.
