**Main question:** In what way should we discuss the use of violence by activists?

**Final answer:** This discussion is still ongoing.

> **This is a discussion page.** We encourage the use of the comment section to exchange arguments. Please keep it civilised and stick to our [principles](/about/principles).
> 
> Please keep in mind that arguments made by individual contributors do not necessarily reflect the position of Activist Handbook. Discussion pages serve as a way to ensure we define our principles in a transparent and democratic manner. In addition, we organise video calls to have more personal and dynamic conversations about the discussion topics.

**Things to keep in mind:**

-   There are many definitions of what 'violence' entails.
-   Various forms of violence are illegal in large parts of the world, which could have implications for the legality of Activist Handbook's content.

**Some possible answers:**

-   We should not discuss violence at all.
-   We discuss how violence is being used by activists. However, we clearly condemn the use of violence.
-   We discuss how violence is being used by activists. We show all sides of the debate.
-   We should be allowed to discuss violent tactics, without any disclaimers.

**Concrete examples:**

-   In our references, we currently refer to _The Anarchist Cookbook_ by William Powell, a book which "provides instructions for making bombs, drugs, and operating firearms" ([Davis, 2019](https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/anarchist-cookbook)). Should we allow referencing to resources that provide instructions for violent tactics?

## Resources

_Feel free to add external resources that relate to the discussion topic._

A key text which convincingly shows that non-violent movements have historically generally been much more successful than violent ones (used as one of the foundational texts for Extinction Rebellion), is [‘Why Civil Resistance Works’](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10056014-why-civil-resistance-works) by Chenoweth and Stephan. A shorter free pdf essay of the same name is free to read [_here._](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/IS3301_pp007-044_Stephan_Chenoweth.pdf)
