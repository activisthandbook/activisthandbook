**In this chapter, we explain how to get started with grassroots organizing. Our toolkit explains how to build a movement by looking at successful examples.**

> **Chapter quality**: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5)

## Start organizing

To build an impactful grassroots movement, start small. Organize a protest action that helps you to grow your group. Next, plan a campaign: a series of actions to pressure decision-makers. Then scale up by building a decentralized movement. Finally, improve your teamwork by learning from other movements.

## Q&A

### **What is grassroots organizing?**

Grassroots organizing is a way of working with communities to create change from the ground up. It involves building relationships with people, mobilizing resources and taking collective action to address the issues that affect them. It is a way of empowering people to take action and create positive change in their own lives.

### What is community organizing?

Community organizing is a form of activism and grassroots organizing that involves bringing people together to work on a shared goal or cause. It involves engaging people in their local community to identify common issues and goals and then taking action together to address those issues and achieve said goals.

### How to start a grassroots movement?

To start a grassroots movement, identify a cause you are passionate about, gather like-minded people, create a plan of action, and spread the word. Take a look at the many guides in the Activist Handbook to get started.

## Case studies

> **This section still needs to be written.** What methods and types of organisation have been used, and why, and how successful have they been? Has direct democracy or some other form of horizontal organising method been used? If not, why? Includes studies of leadership.
