**Contributing to Activist Handbook should be easy. That is why we wrote some guides to help you get started. If you are a new volunteer, this is the place to be.**

## General guides

We know that seeing all of these guides can be a bit overwhelming. At the very least, we recommend new volunteers to read our article on [**the basics**](/support/basics).

We try to make our organisation accessible to everyone. Read our article on [**accessibility**](/support/accessibility) if you have trouble understanding English, technology related issues or need special facilities in order to participate.

-   **💰** [**Solidarity fund**](/solidarity-fund): Contribute to our solidarity fund to make Activist Handbook accessible for everyone.
-   **🏡** [**Our organisation**](/support/organisation)**:** We work with _circles_ and _roles_. Both have clearly defined what their _purpose_, _domain_ and _accountabilities_ are. Read this article to find out more about who does what.
-   **📝** [**Our meetings**](/support/meetings): We meet on a regular basis. Read this guide to find out what kind of meetings we have.
-   **👩‍💻** [**Tools we use**](/support/tools): All volunteers use Slack to communicate. Google Workspace is for our calendar, email, video calls and files. Read this guide to find out how to get started with these tools.
-   **🔗** [**Using our website**](/support/website)**:** Anyone can edit pages on our website. To learn more about how to use tags, translations, version history and more, read this article.
-   **❤️** [**Wellbeing guide**](/support/wellbeing-volunteers) and [**inclusivity guide**](/support/inclusivity-volunteers) for volunteers (needs to be written).
