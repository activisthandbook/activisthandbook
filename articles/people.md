On this page, we list people who have made important contributions to activism. They are noteworthy figures within movements and people that furthered the 'profession' of being an effective activist.

> The purpose of this page is not to define which activists are important (thus deserving their own page) and which are not.
> 
> Throughout Activist Handbook, we refer to individuals whenever they are relevant in those particular guides. We create pages about these people to provide additional context about their contributions to activism.
