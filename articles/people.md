On this page, we list people who have made important contributions to activism. They are noteworthy figures within movements and people that furthered the 'profession' of being an effective activist.

## Evaluation criteria

The purpose of this page is not to define which activists are important (thus deserving their own page) and which are not.

Throughout Activist Handbook, we refer to individuals whenever they are relevant in those particular guides. We create pages about these people to provide additional context about their contributions to activism. In addition, we create pages about freelance activist trainers.
