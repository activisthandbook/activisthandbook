**In this chapter, we explain what a campaign strategy is. We give examples of different types of campaign strategies that activists use. And we provide templates and workshops to develop your own strategy.**

> **Chapter quality**: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5)

## Introduction

This is **a series of guides** for people who have a strong drive to bring about change but do not know where to begin. With a good campaign strategy, you will make more impact. In these guides, we help you define what exactly the change is that you want to achieve, and what steps you need to take to get there:

## What is a campaign strategy?

A campaign strategy is a **plan or roadmap** **that helps you achieve your goal** of creating some form of change in the world. It is made up out of these basic elements:

### **1\. Vision 💡**

Your [**vision**](https://activisthandbook.org/strategy/vision) is your analysis of the root problem and your big ideas on how to make the world a better place.

> **_Example_**_: You might argue that the climate crisis is caused by a political system that gives more power to people with lots of money. However, you still believe there is the possibility_ of _changing this unfair system, by getting together enough people. You want to build a new political system that gives a voice to everyone, especially those impacted most by the climate crisis._

### 2\. Stakeholders 🌐

[**Stakeholders**](https://activisthandbook.org/strategy/stakeholders) are all the individuals, groups of people and organisations that are relevant to your movement.

> **_Example:_** _You might want to analyse who are the stakeholders for your climate justice campaign. First of all, there are the people who are impacted by the climate crisis. Secondly, you have a list of allies, such as other environmental organisations. Thirdly, you have opponents because they profit from the current system, such as fossil fuel companies and politicians that get funded by them. Finally, you have targets, such as political parties that usually get a lot of votes from people who care about the climate._

### 3\. Goals 🎯

Your [**goals**](https://activisthandbook.org/strategy/goals) are the concrete things that you want to achieve with your movement. Your goals define the scope of what your movement focuses on, within your broader vision.

> **_Example:_** _Your movement has the goal of letting people decide about the future of our planet, instead of the lobbyists of fossil fuel companies._ _You want to do so by demanding from your politicians to organise a citizens assembly that has the power to implement new environmental policies._

### 4\. Objectives ✅

The best way of understanding [**objectives**](https://activisthandbook.org/strategy/objectives) without confusing them with goals is to identify them as specific tasks that explain exactly how the goals are achieved. Objectives are the most specific elements of strategies and are mostly used to decide on action plans. Ideally, they are SMART:

-   Specific and Strategic
    
-   Measurable
    
-   Achievable
    
-   Realistic
    
-   Time bound.
    

> **_Example_**_: You want your national parliament to organise a citizens assembly about the climate crisis. As a first step, you set the following objective: you want all major news media to write about your idea of a citizens assembly in the coming month because you think this will help create public support._

### 5\. Tactics 📢

[**Tactics**](https://activisthandbook.org/tactics) are something we have an entire chapter about. They are, in a nutshell, concrete series of actions that we plan and execute in order to meet our strategic goals. Depending on your strategies some tactics might be more relevant than others. Different tactics attract people with different values and have varying degrees of success. Make sure not to confuse tactics and values. _Solidarity_ or _youth participation_are not tactics, those are values that tactics such as cooperatives or student parliaments might help strengthen.

> **_Example:_** _You want all major news media to write about your idea of a citizens assembly. To achieve that, you want to use the tactic of putting up posters. Your plan is to distribute 5.000 large posters throughout the country with a controversial statement on it, in the hope of getting lots of media attention._

### 6\. Evaluation 📊

The [**evaluation**](https://activisthandbook.org/strategy/evaluation) is important to reflect on what you are doing and determine whether it is effective. We want to have reliable ways of evaluating our own success and that can help us see our weak spots so we can improve them. Metrics play a very important role in this type of measurement.

> **_Example:_** _Putting up posters was only your first step in getting closer to a citizens assembly. You want to know if using posters as a means to get media attention worked: How many news media wrote about your action? Do you now have enough public support so you can move on to the next phase in your campaign strategy, or do you still have some work to do there first?_

## Key principles

-   **Context is key:** A strategy is a roadmap that helps you get from A to B. Where are you now? Where do you want to go? What obstacles will you come across trying to reach your goal?
    
-   **Conflict is good**

-   **Make it scalable**
    
-   **Build people power**
    
-   **Always act strategically**
    
-   **Dare to take risks**
    
-   **Take time to reflect**
    

## Strategy sizes

Strategies come in different sizes: there are small plans to bring about small change, and big plans to bring about big change.

Some activists like to make small plans, because they feel that they have more control over things that are close to them. Other activists like to think about big plans, because they want to see big change. As an effective change-maker, you need to learn to do both, and balance them:

-   **Develop small, actionable, plans:** While dreaming about big plans to create a better world is valuable, it can also be a bit too theoretical. Small strategies enable you to determine what you are going to do today, tomorrow, and the few next months.
    
-   **Understand how small actions fit within bigger stories:** While taking action is good, it can be a bit demotivating to compare the small footprint of your actions with the scale of the fucked-up-ness of the world. For your mental health, it is essential to understand your role within the bigger picture. Dare to dream big, because you are not alone, and together big change is possible.
    

The smaller the plan, the more concrete things become for you as an individual player within that strategy. The bigger the plan, the better you understand the way the world works.

### Campaigns, movements & revolutions

To make our guides a bit more concrete, instead of talking about 'small' and 'big' strategies, Activist Handbook discusses the following three levels of strategies:

1.  **Campaign strategy:** a plan for a few months that helps you achieve relatively small but meaningful change. You cannot change the world with a single campaign, but many campaigns can. Your campaign can be the tipping point.
    
2.  **Movement strategy:** a bigger story that keeps people involved with your organisation over the span of multiple campaigns. The more persistent your activism, the bigger issues you can address. Movements stay around much longer than campaigns and can thus bring about more fundamental change, but they also come with their own unique challenges.
    
3.  [**Revolution strategy**](/theory/revolution): a story that tells how power is redistributed on a societal level, as the result of the collective effort of many activist groups and organisations. It is not possible for an individual to develop a strategy for a revolution, but it is possible to understand their workings and redefine their workings by introducing new perspectives. The most visible part of a revolution (the short moment big change suddenly happens) is not the most interesting thing from the perspective of strategies (all the things that happen before and after are).
    

## Common challenges

### Balancing urgency and strategy

Activists are often driven by deep passion and urgency about their cause. This sense of urgency can sometimes lead to hastily planned strategies that may not be as effective in the long run.

### Conflict within the group

Differences in opinion on campaign strategies can lead to internal conflicts within the activist group. This can result in time and energy spent on dealing with internal issues rather than focusing on the campaign itself.

### Goal setting

Defining clear, achievable goals can be difficult, especially in movements that aim for significant systemic change. Without clear goals, it can be hard to maintain motivation or measure progress.

## Strategy is not everything

Organising a successful campaign is about more than just having a good strategy. We recommend you to read our guide on [**how to organise a campaign**](https://activisthandbook.org/organising/campaign) to learn about all other aspects, such as communicating your message, taking care of the wellbeing of your volunteers, your legal rights, and much more.

## Conclusion

Now you know what basic elements make up a campaign strategy. Make sure to dive into our in-depth guides that we have linked above, so you can learn how to put your theoretical knowledge into practice.

## Local context

The local context across countries can impact activists trying to develop their strategy in various ways. For example, the political system, the legal framework, the media landscape, the cultural norms, and the public opinion can all affect the opportunities and challenges that activists face. Depending on the context, activists may need to adapt their goals, tactics, messages, allies, and risks. Some general examples are:

-   **In a democratic country** with a strong civil society and a free press, activists may have more space to voice their demands and mobilize support through peaceful protests, petitions, campaigns, and lobbying.
    
-   **In an authoritarian country** with a repressive regime and a controlled media, activists may have less space to express their dissent and may face more threats and violence. They may need to use more covert and creative ways to communicate and organize, such as encryption, art, humor, or symbolism.
    
-   **In a country with a diverse and divided society**, activists may have to deal with different and sometimes conflicting interests and identities among their potential supporters and opponents. They may need to build bridges and coalitions across different groups and sectors, and avoid alienating or polarizing others.
    
-   **In a country with a dominant and oppressive culture**, activists may have to challenge deeply ingrained norms and values that justify or normalize injustice and discrimination. They may need to raise awareness and educate people about the issues they are fighting for, and use cultural expressions and narratives that resonate with their audience.
