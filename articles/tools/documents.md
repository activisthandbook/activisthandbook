### Coda

Coda is very similar to Notion.

### Airtable

[Airtable](/tools/airtable) is an advanced Goole Sheets alternative. Using ‘views’, you can display the same data in various ways (e.g. filtering, grouping). You can also link datapoints between different tables. Finally, there are various apps to automate processes.

### Workflowy

Workflowy is a quick note-taking app.

### Anytype

Anytype is an open source alternative for Notion or Coda. All data is saved locally, and if you share it across devices or people, the content is end-to-end encrypted.
