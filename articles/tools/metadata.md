Metadata is often described as everything _except_ the content of your communications. You can think of metadata as the digital equivalent of an envelope. Just like an envelope contains information about the sender, receiver, and destination of a message, so does metadata. Metadata is information about the digital communications you send and receive. Some examples of metadata include:

-   the name and members of your group chats
    
-   the length of your conversations
    
-   the time frame in which a conversation took place
    
-   your location when communicating (as well as with whom)
