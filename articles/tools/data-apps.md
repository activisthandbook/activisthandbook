## Difference spreadsheets and modern data apps

Spreadsheets used to be primarily for storing numbers. With modern data platforms, it is possible to create entire custom apps. As a digital organizer, you can now easily build dedicated tools for your activist campaign.

For example, you can use data apps to:

-   **Manage your list of volunteers:** build your own CRM to integrate new volunteers.
    
-   **Keep track of projects:** create a timeline, keep track of to-do's using a Trello-style Kanban view.
    
-   **Moderate website content:** set up your data app as content management system (CMS)
    

## Traditional spreadsheets

### Excel

Microsoft Excel is probably the most well known spreadsheet app. While it has many advanced features, it becomes more difficult to use very quickly. Other tools are often better suited when it comes to collaboration, automation and managing large amounts of data.

### Google Sheets

Google Sheets is great for collaboration. And if you have a developer on your team, you can do much more using [Apps Script, custom functions and integrations](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets?utm_source=activisthandbook.org). However, if you do not have a developer, you might want to have a look at the modern data apps which are often easier to use for complex tasks.

## Modern data apps

### What are data apps?

-   **Special views:** sometimes it does not make sense to display data in boring rows, introducing... calendar views, maps, kanban, timelimes, Gantt and card galleries!
    
-   **Automation:** connect your spreadsheet data with any other tool.
    
-   **Collaboration:** manage access using user groups and collaborate with comments and version history.
    

### Comparing platforms

Each data app offers slightly different functionality. Make sure to choose the tool that best fits your use-case.

#### Airtable (commercial)

Airtable is the easiest to use data tool from this list. View your data as a spreadsheet grid, calendar, card gallery, kanban, timeline or Gantt. It is also possible to create a [form](https://support.airtable.com/docs/how-to-create-a-form-in-airtable?utm_source=activisthandbook.org) to collect data.
