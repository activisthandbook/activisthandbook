Evaluation criteria:

-   **Pricing**: Is there a special plan for registered non-profits? Is it affordable for people who are not part of a registered organisation?
-   **Open source & self-hosted:** Is the source code publicly available? Can the platform easily be set up for self-hosting? Relevant if you do not want to work with evil big business.
-   **Ease of use:** How much training is required before people can use the tools?
-   **Functionality:** Are file storage, collaborative documents (text editor, presentations, spreadsheets), communication platform and video calls available?
