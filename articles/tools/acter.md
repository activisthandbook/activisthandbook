## Acter

Acter is designed for activists and changemakers who are driving change but lack the right tools.

The app is built to protect the civil society.

**Acter is changing the way we build, own, and govern critical infrastructure.**

## Built to protect civil society

How? Acter has:

🔒 Multilayered safeguarding

🔒Decentralized structure, public source & non-profit

🔒Built on the Matrix protocol, like Signal

The Matrix protocol delivers Acter a technology that is:

[• End-to-End Encrypted](/tools/end-to-end-encryption)

• Interoperable with all Matrix clients

• Bridging to existing platforms (e.g. Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram)

• Decentralized

## Built for collective action

By using Acter, organizers and activists are enabled to

💡Coordinate across movements

💡Create events

💡Delegate tasks

💡Bridging to instant messaging apps, like [WhatsApp](/tools/chat-apps/whatsapp), [Signal](/tools/chat-apps/signal), [Telegram](/tools/chat-apps/telegram)

💡Onboard and engage people easily

**📲 No internet no problem**

Shortly, Acter will also support offline capabilities in areas with little to no

Internet access or with internet shutdowns.
