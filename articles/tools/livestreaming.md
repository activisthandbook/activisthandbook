**As the world increasingly moves online, more and more activists are using live streaming to reach larger audiences and get their message out. While live streaming can be a great way to connect with supporters, it also comes with its own set of challenges.

-   **Connect to video call (easy & cheap):** For example, join in a Jitsi video call and [connect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=970gdTXZXOs) it to a Youtube Livestream (see illustration and video below).
-   **Stream from streaming apps to switching software (advanced & cheap):** For example, record live video using [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/) to another computer running OBS Studio. You will need a fast computer to do this.
-   **Professional live streaming software or hardware (advanced, more reliable & expensive):** For example, read this [article](https://www.dacast.com/blog/simulcast-streaming/).
