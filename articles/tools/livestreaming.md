### **Multiple cameras, different locations**

If you want to live stream an event with multiple people streaming their video from different locations, you have various options:

-   **Connect to video call (easy & cheap):** For example, join in a Jitsi video call and [connect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=970gdTXZXOs) it to a Youtube Livestream (see illustration and video below).
    
-   **Stream from streaming apps to switching software (advanced & cheap):** For example, record live video using [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/) to another computer running OBS Studio. You will need a fast computer to do this.
    
-   **Professional live streaming software or hardware (advanced, more reliable & expensive):** For example, read this [article](https://www.dacast.com/blog/simulcast-streaming/).
    

### Multiple cameras, single location

You have several options for video stream inputs:

-   **From your phone:** For example, use OBS Camera to live stream from your phone to OBS on your computer using a cable or over WiFi.
    
-   **From your webcam:** [Add your webcam](https://www.wikihow.com/Add-a-Webcam-to-OBS-on-PC-or-Mac) to OBS Studio.
    
-   **From a camera:** Share your video stream from a DLSR camera to OBS Studio using a capture card like the Elgato Cam Link.
