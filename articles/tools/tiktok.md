## How to contribute

Oops, you have stumbled upon one of our more empty pages. But you can make it better! Just create an account and start editing.

Most articles about TikTok activism have the following issues: (1) they are written in magazine style, not as practical guides; (2) they are not critical of its censorship; (3) they are not evaluating the actual impact made. In other words: they are wasting people's time by letting them believe they will magically start making societal change by using TikTok. We can do better.

Suggestions for topics to talk about:

-   How to avoid a shadow ban
    
-   Criteria for good videos
    
-   How to measure actual impact made (and evaluate whether filming yourself dancing, for example, is worth the effort)
