## **Social media platforms**

While most popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are owned by big tech, they are still a useful tool in growing your movement. In our guides we explain how to set up your socials to mobilise and engage people for your cause, while being critical of so called ‚Äòclicktivism‚Äô.

We talk about how to use these platforms effectively for outreach and promotion of protest actions. In addition, we give practical advise on how to work around censorship and shadow bans.

## Social media management tools

With users spread out over so many different platforms, it can be hard to create good content for all, especially for small to medium sized movements. Social media management tools can help you work more efficiently:

-   **Facebook Business Suite**: A free tool developed to manage your Facebook and Instagram profiles in one dashboard.
    
-   **Buffer**
    
-   **Hootsuite**
    
-   **Sprout Social**
    

## Local context

Activists who use social media to promote their causes need to be aware of the local context across countries, as it can impact their effectiveness and safety. For example, some countries may have different laws, norms, or censorship policies that affect how activists can communicate online.

Some countries may also have different levels of internet access, digital literacy, or media freedom that influence how activists can reach and mobilize their audiences. Therefore, activists should tailor their social media strategies to the specific context of each country they operate in, and be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances.
