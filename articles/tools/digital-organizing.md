## Introduction

Welcome to this beginner's guide to digital organising for the activist of the new era. It's a world where mobile screens create stronger bonds than physical spaces, notably in rallying activists to drive real-world change. This guide shines a spotlight on practical, effective methods of digital organising, methods that will transform your online presence into real-life impact.

Digital organising is not just about accumulating follower counts on social backdrops. It's about facilitating collective action.
