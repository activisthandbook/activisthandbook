## What is a tech stack?

A tech stack is a collection of tools. Together, they form your digital infrastructure. Think of it as a city: you need a hospital, a school, and a town hall. As your city grows, your infrastructure requirements change. For example, first, you might only need busses, but later you also need a metro system. As your city grows organically, you might get stuck with infrastructure does not fit your current needs any more, which might also limit your growth or make it less accessible for some.

In this guide, we help you set up a digital infrastructure that fits an organisation of your size. We also give some advice on how to make sure it is scalable. But first, we explain what categories of tools exist.

## Categories of tools

### Tools made by activists

We start with a special category: [**movement building tools**](/tools/organising). These tools were built specifically for activists, by activists.

Having worked with commercially available tools, these activists decided the perfect tool did not exist, so they built it themselves. Their unique set of features make these tools difficult to put into a single category, so we created a separate category all together.

### Internal collaboration

The apps in this category help activists work together better. These are mostly tools that you might find in any business office.

#### Productivity suites

[**Productivity suites**](/tools/productivity-suites) are all-in-one packages for internal collaboration. They are a set of tools that work well together. But of course you can also decide to pick and choose from the individual tools below!

#### Communication apps

-   **üí¨** [**Chat apps**](/tools/chat-apps)**:** From WhatsApp to Slack, we compare chat apps that organisations of different sizes can use. And we evaluate things such as security and privacy.
    
-   **‚òéÔ∏è** [**Video calling**](https://activisthandbook.org/tools/video-calling)**:** Since the COVID pandemic, there are lots of video calling tools to choose from. We outline the best tools for different use cases, from creative brainstorms with small groups to large general assemblies.
    

#### Project management

Keep track of to-do's, project timelines, and divide responsibilities using these [**project management tools**](/tools/project-management). We outline how you can get most out of tools such as Trello and Glassfrog.
