Tools in this category come in different shapes and sizes, catering to the needs of different types of organization, offering more or less customization options and features for bigger organizations.

If you have never used a tool of this kind, you don't know what your organization really needs, but you want to start writing down people's commitments and activities, a good starting point is [Trello](https://trello.com), an all-rounder tool fit for small-sized organizations.
