### **A guide to personal social media security**

Your personal safety online will depend on how many people can access things you post, but in general it's better to be safe than sorry. The more people that follow you, the greater the risk of online issues. There is a web of social media accounts that could potentially make people unsafe so keeping your account secure is not only for your own sake, but also for everyone else.

This is **not an exhaustive list** of things that will guarantee your safety, but hopefully it will help you start thinking about measures that can be taken to keep yourself, and those around you, safe online. Even though this is important, the extent to which you follow it to will depend on how much risk you take in actions.

-   Do not have your full name on there anywhere, if you need to do this for whatever reason, make sure the account isn't linked to you or your activist group in any way. This is especially important in the username/name/bio where anyone can see it but also within your posts. And do not put your school/location in your bio (saying what city you live in is probably ok), I would advise against putting your age/birth year in your profile but this is less serious. Also don't have your chosen/legal name and activist name in the same account.
    
-   As a general rule, have private social media accounts. Art accounts are different if they're very distinct from your main but be careful with identifying information on these. Self portraits and art of locations near you count as identifying information. If you have an art or activist account, these should be separate and not follow/link to each other (especially linking from your art account to your main). If you have posted a piece of art in a signal chat, do not post it to a public art account that has your name/could identify you in any way. If you post something to signal and also to a public account, it is much easier to link your social media (real identity) to your activist ‘persona’.
    
-   Go through your followers and make sure that you actually know the people who follow you. If someone requests/follows you who you don't know, don't give them access to your account. If it's someone you vaguely know (e.g. you've met them once), you do not know that person and should not give them access to your account (this is different to an actual friend of a friend). It is so easy to make fake accounts and you shouldn't trust that someone is your friend if you don't know them.
    
-   You should not be identifiable to someone looking at your profile who doesn't follow you. This means that if your name is in your profile, your profile picture should not be an identifiable photo or drawing. This is because if there's any crossover between your account and someone else's, your profile may be recommended to people like adult supporters who could recognise your face but shouldn't know your name.
    
-   Even though at this point no one should have access to your posts unless you actually know them, there's still a chance that your info could get out. Try not to post information that clearly identify your home, school, full name (especially legal), etc.
    
-   You should try to 'dox' your own accounts or ask a friend to help you do so. This means trying to figure out as much about yourself as you can using the internet, looking at your account through the perspective of someone trying to find information about you. Google image search your posts (often even generic street photos can really narrow down your location), check tagged posts, highlights, posts, comments, all of it.
    
-   Go back and find all social media accounts you've ever had. Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, Bluesky, Reddit, Discord, etc. If you're not using an account any more and it could be linked to you, either hibernate it, delete it, or archive/delete everything from it and change the name/username to some combination of letters/numbers.
    
-   This point is specifically for discord but also applies to Instagram and other social medias. Check what is linked to your profile, including Spotify pages, etc etc. And be aware that your followers/following may be visible to people even if they don't follow you. You can remove these from discord app -> settings -> connections (clicking on "add" will show you this list). Here is a list of profiles that can be connected to your Discord: [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/uk/home), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/), [Twitter/X](https://x.com/home), [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/), [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/), [PlayStation Network](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/playstation-network/), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/), [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/), [Amazon Music](https://music.amazon.co.uk/), [Battle.net](http://Battle.net), [Bungie.net](http://Bungie.net), domain, [Epic Games](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/), [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en), [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
    
-   This point is specifically for LinkedIn. Do not have your (full) name and school/location on LinkedIn. TERFs are so good at doxing and this just makes it far too easy to get really personal information about you.
    
-   If your school or any other activities (including youth groups, sports teams, scouting, etc) you take part in have a social media presence, you can retract your photo consent and they won't be allowed to post photos of you (sometimes they'll talk to your guardians about this, even if you're 16+). Removing/Not having these images public reduces the risk of someone recognising you or being able to find identifying information about you using technology.
    
-   Your Signal profile should not link to any of your personal social medias. This means the username should be different, the profile pictures should be different, and there should be nothing in your bio that could link to you personally.
    
-   This point is less important but a good reminder for general practice, especially if you have a public account at any point. If posting stories of your location, even if they're central/very famous places, wait until you've left the place to post it. This means that your current location can't be found as easily so there's less risk of someone trying to find out where you are.
    
-   Keep each other safe. Don't post photos or tag people without asking them first – other people's risk factors will be different to yours and you should let them decide what information is shared.
