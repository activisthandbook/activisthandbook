The [Federation of Young European Greens](https://www.fyeg.org/) is a collaboration of various [Green political youth organisations in Europe](https://www.fyeg.org/who-we-are/member-organizations).

The Federation of Young European Greens, or in short FYEG, is the European umbrella organisation for Young Green organisations from all over the continent, from Georgia to Ireland and from Cyprus to Norway. FYEG's 36 member organisations comprise various backgrounds: local ecological groups, student unions, youth wings of Green parties and Green Youth NGOs. In addition, the Federation is also the independent, official youth wing of the [European Green Party (EGP)](https://europeangreens.eu/).

FYEG also works closely with its sister organisation for Eastern Europe, the [Cooperation and Development Network Eastern Europe (CDN)](/cdnee).

[Cooperation and Development Network Eastern Europe (CDN)](https://www.cdnee.org/) is a capacity-building network of youth organisations committed to the development and implementation of Green ideas in Eastern Europe. As of 2022, CDN gathers 14 member and 6 partner organisations – ­ youth wings of Green parties and NGOs whose work is rooted in Green values. CDN’s political focus is on Eastern Europe where the organisation works with local partners. CDN also collaborates with organisations and activists from the rest of Europe who want to support a Green Eastern Europe.

### Structures

As an organisation, FYEG consists of different [bodies](https://www.fyeg.org/who-we-are/structures): the General Assembly, the Executive Committee, Working Groups, the Ecosprinter Editorial Board and the office. The organisation is run by a voluntary Executive Committee, the Editorial Board of Ecosprinter (the FYEG online magazine), and the members of our working groups.

The Committee and the Editorial Board are elected by the Member Organisations once every year. In addition, a Secretary General is being elected every two years. The Secretary General works in the FYEG office in Brussels, alongside with the Project Assistant. The office of FYEG is located in close proximity to the [European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en), and is shared with the European Green Party. Staff members in the office include the Secretary General, a Project Manager, an Office Manager, a Project Assistant, a Communications Officer, an Administrative Assistant and two paid interns. Last but not least, FYEG is supported by a webmaster on a voluntary basis.

-   Establish a pool of FYEG-close experts to reach out to as speakers for events, members of internal structures requiring experience (i.e. members of Presidency for the GA, members of Advisory Committee), or FYEG nominees for external structures (i.e. positions within European Youth Forum, the EGP or other)
-   Provide a platform (online and offline, transnational and local) for FYEG activists and former FYEG activists to meet, learn, get inspired, keep up-to-date with FYEG and have fun
-   Contribute to the long-term financial stability of FYEG through donations, small or big, from former FYEG activists who are interested to give back to the network

**The members of the Alumni Network are:**

-   Former Co-Spokespersons or Executive Committee members
-   Former Office members
-   Former members of an FYEG Working Group or another structure
