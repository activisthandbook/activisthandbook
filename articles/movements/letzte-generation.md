Letzte Generation is a group of activists fighting climate change in Germany. They use civil disobedience methods, such as desecrating artworks or blocking roads. In 2022, the group performed 276 road blockades in Germany. The group has also thrown soup at a van Gogh painting behind glass, called The Sower.
