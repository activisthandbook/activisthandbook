## Share your work

If your organisation writes guides for activists, you can also publish them on Activist Handbook. There are two ways of doing so:

1.  **Add your guides to our handbook:** Learn how to [start writing for Activist Handbook](/contribute/write), and check out our guide on how to [add your materials](/contribute/write/external-resources) to our platform.
    
2.  **Create a section on our platform for your organisation:** Say your organisation is called 'Save the Polar Bears', we can create a section on our website '_activisthandbook.org/polar-bears_' for your organisation. You can use this section to publish guides for your members. Contact us for more information: [contact@activisthandbook.org](mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org)

## Our principles

We are here for social, progressive and green rebels all over the globe. We believe that effective change-making is all about empowering marginalised communities and providing people with the right tools and training.

To formulate these core ideas, we wrote a set of [principles](/about/principles). We only work together with organisations and movements that align with these principles.
