In this guide, you will learn to think about the engagement flow from your movement. We will explain how you can define the engagement flow, also called engagement ladder, for your movement.

> **Article quality**: ⭐️ (1/5)

Engagement is a key goal for any nonprofit or activist organization, and having a solid engagement flow in place is essential for success. An engagement flow is a plan that outlines how you will engage with your audience, how you will build relationships with them, and how you will encourage them to take action.

An engagement flow, also called engagement ladder, is a way to categorise and segment the people involved in your action, from the most committed to the least committed.

## Engagement ladder

You'r engagement ladder you can be split up in two different sections. The external engagement ladder and the internal engagement ladder. the external engagement ladder are people who haven't been active in the organisation and are mostly reached by communication tactics. The internal engagement ladder is for activists and volunteers and are mostly reached by organising tactics.

For someone to become a leader this person first has to go through al other stages of the ladder. This means before someone has their first action they first have to become aware, familiair and consider the organisation. In some situations these 3 stept can be taken in half an hour and other times this might take half a year or more.

**Communication**

1.  Awareness
    
2.  Familiarity
    
3.  Consideration
    

**Organising**

1.  First action
    

1.  Active participant
    
2.  Potential leader
    
3.  Leader
    

### Communication

In the first stept of the engagement ladder we talk about communication. This means this is mostly a one way street. You, the organisation, communicates while the public receives the communications. Your goal is to convince the public that they align with your cause.

**Awareness**

At the lowest rung, the public completes an easy action such as looking at your seeing an article or having a conversation with one of your activists/ volunteers. They realise your organisation and/ or actions exists and have a vague idea what you stand for.

**Familiarity**

In the second phase the public becomes more aware of your organisation. They have a fairly good idea about your standpoints and has seen your organisation at least in a few different communications.

**Consideration**

In the third phase the public becomes a supporter of the cause. They actively search for more information about your organisation or action and start to consider whether or not they want to be associated with the cause. They will for example visit the website, get in contact or visit an information event.

### Organising

In the second part of the engagement ladder the public becomes an active supporter and the one way street becomes a two way street. Together you figure out the relation you have with eachother other. You discover each others skills and weaknesses.

It is not advisable to instantly make a new volunteer a leader. By letting them become more and more active you have the chance to get learn to eachother. Before putting someone in a leading position you want to try and figure whether or not they are capable to do this. Important: Not everyone will become a leader. It is perfectly fine for people to stay an active participant, potential leader or even only join the first action. In this proces you figure out whether someone fits in the group and is able to add something to the group.

**First action**

For the first action try to give your new volunteer a small task. For example if you organise an information evening let them welcome visitors, or when walking doors, let them go with an experienced volunteer. If they succeed, you can give them more responsibilities.

**Active participant**

When the volunteers is enthusiastic you can give them more and more responsibilities that align with their motivations and skills.

**Potential leader**

If the volunteer shows potential for leading skills you can start to see them as a potential leader. Try to test this by giving this person small leading tasks like organising a bigger evenent or leading a small group people for a project.

**Leader**

The most trustworthy people with skills to lead and facilitate you can eventually make a leader. They will facilitate al the important processes in the group.
