**In this article, you will learn how to reach the news media with your actions. We will discuss how to organise actions that news media will want to pick up. And we will talk about how to write a good press release.**

## Write a press release

The news media is always looking for a good story, and if you are planning an activist action, you can make sure they find out about it by writing a press release.

A press release is a short, news-style article that tells the media what you are doing and why it is important. Here are some tips for writing a press release that will get the media's attention:

1.  Make it newsworthy: Write about something that is timely and relevant, and that will interest the media and their audiences.
2.  Keep it short and to the point: A press release should be no more than one page, and it should get straight to the point.
3.  Include quotes: Quotes from people involved in the action, or from experts on the issue, can make your press release more newsworthy and persuasive.
4.  Include a photo: A photo can make your press release more visually appealing and help it stand out from the crowd.
5.  5Send it to the right people: Make sure you send your press release to the right media outlets, and to the specific reporters who cover the issue you are concerned with.
