## Write a press release

The news media is always looking for a good story, and if you are planning an activist action, you can make sure they find out about it by writing a press release.

A press release is a short, news-style article that tells the media what you are doing and why it is important. Here are some tips for writing a press release that will get the media's attention:

1.  Make it newsworthy: Write about something that is timely and relevant, and that will interest the media and their audiences.
    
2.  Keep it short and to the point: A press release should be no more than one page, and it should get straight to the point.
    
3.  Include quotes: Quotes from people involved in the action, or from experts on the issue, can make your press release more newsworthy and persuasive.
    
4.  Include a photo: A photo can make your press release more visually appealing and help it stand out from the crowd.
    
5.  5Send it to the right people: Make sure you send your press release to the right media outlets, and to the specific reporters who cover the issue you are concerned with.
    

## Local context

Activists trying to get attention from mainstream news media face different challenges depending on the local contexts of the countries they operate in. Here are some of the common challenges and possible solutions:

-   **In countries with authoritarian regimes or weak democracies**, activists may face legal restrictions, censorship, intimidation, harassment, or violence from the state or its allies. To overcome these challenges, activists may use alternative media platforms, such as social media, podcasts, blogs, or online magazines, to reach a wider audience and bypass state control. They may also seek international solidarity and support from other civil society groups, human rights organizations, or foreign media outlets that can amplify their voices and pressure their governments to respect their rights.
    
-   **In countries with high levels of social polarization or political conflict**, activists may struggle to gain trust and legitimacy from the public or the media, especially if they are perceived as partisan, biased, or radical. To overcome these challenges, activists may adopt a more inclusive and dialogical approach, engaging with diverse stakeholders and perspectives, and building coalitions and alliances with other social movements, NGOs, or local communities. They may also use evidence-based arguments and data to support their claims and demonstrate their impact.
    
-   **In countries with low public awareness or interest in your cause**, activists may find it hard to attract media attention or mobilize public opinion. To overcome these challenges, activists may use creative and innovative methods to communicate their messages and raise awareness, such as art, music, humor, storytelling, or campaigns. They may also appeal to the values and emotions of their audiences, highlighting the urgency and relevance of their causes and how they affect their lives.

    -   Activists have to deal with the biases and agendas of mass media outlets, which may ignore, misrepresent or discredit their causes and actions.
