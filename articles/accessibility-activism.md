## Examples of Accessible Spaces

### Accessible Activism

As activists, we strive to create a world that is just and equitable for all. But have we stopped to think about whether our own spaces are truly accessible? Learn more about [Accessible Activism](activisthandbook.org/en/accessible-activism)!

Making our activism spaces accessible is not only a moral imperative, but also a strategic one. When we prioritize accessibility, we tap into the wisdom, creativity, and energy of disabled activists and community members.

#### Examples

An Accessible Discord Server begins with holding space for people to make accessibility requests. No need to take additional action unless it's requested.

1.  Include some accessibility info in #welcome, #rules, or similar high-traffic or mandatory channels.
    
2.  Utilize a Discord App like [BotZilla](https://discord.com/application-directory/1038875433690730596) for private accessibility support tickets. This can look like
    
    1.  User clicks a button to request accommodation
        
    2.  BotZilla creates a private thread with the User
        
    3.  Moderators or other permission groups can see the thread and assist the User
        
    4.  More organization options include claiming tickets, closing tickets, and server staff or volunteers dedicated to assisting with accessibility needs
