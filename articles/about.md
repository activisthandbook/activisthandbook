Activist Handbook is a the Wikipedia for change-makers. On our platform, you can find 450+ guides and over 4.7K external resources. Our goal is to train 350 million activists.

## Let's train 350 million activists

All over the globe, green, social and progressive change-makers are trying to make a positive impact. But they often lack the skills to do so effectively.

Science shows that change happens when 3.5% of the population takes action. In 2050, there will be 10 billion people on this planet. That's why we are going to train 350 million activists.

To achieve this goal, we built an online knowledge-sharing platform. It works just like Wikipedia: everyone can edit our articles. This way, we allow activists across countries and movements to exchange their experiences with change-making.

**Right now, we are able to train more than 6000 new activists every month. Help us scale up our project:**

## Our content

### üïä Free & reusable

We publish all our work under a Creative Commons [licence](/about/licence). Other people can freely redistribute and repurpose our work. It's out there for everyone to use, as long as it is not for commercial purposes.

### üìñ Practical how-to guides

We do not write inspirational or entertaining magazine articles. Our guides are practical and to-the-point. Each of our guides addresses a single challenge that activists face and provides step-by-step solutions.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Reusing existing work

We copy other people's work and make it better. There is no point in reinventing the wheel. For each guide, we do extensive research to find out what resources already exist on the topic.

### üóÇ Well-organised content

We organise our content with chapters, sub-topics, tags and lists of related articles: This makes it easier for people to find the content they are looking for, even if they do not quite know the right search term. In addition, we provide a super fast search engine.

### üåè Localised & translated

Activism is different in every region. We translate our content in all languages and adapt it to local contexts.

## Our research

Activist Handbook takes a data-driven approach to training change-makers.

### üîç Analysing search queries

We have analysed over 4.4K search queries that activists type into Google. We know what challenges activists face most, and what words they type into Google to find help. With this SEO data, we can write the guides that activists actually need and make sure our platform is found by the people looking for it.

### üìä Measuring article quality

Over the years, we have developed guidelines for our articles based on what we know works best. We measure reading time, scroll depth and other browsing behaviours to understand which articles need improvement.

## **Our tech**

We don‚Äôt just write guides. Activist Handbook develops digital tools to empower change-makers. We bring together our experience with web development and campaigning.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Speed & accessibility

Everyone should be able to use Activist Handbook, no matter if you are on a slow or expensive data plan. So we put in the work to make that possible. And it shows. For example, our platform loads 8x faster and uses 87% less data than the Beautiful Trouble website (tested using GTmetrix, 25 dec 2022).

### **üí° AI used for change**

Our writers never have to start with an empty page. Using artifical intelligence, we generate a first draft, as well as illustrations to accompany the guide. Whatever tech the capitalist elite can get their hands on to protect their interests, we use it too and fight back.
