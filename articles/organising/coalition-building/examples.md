In this guide, we provide examples of coalition building in activism. Use these case studies as inspiration for your coalition.

> ðŸ“š This guide is part of a series on [**coalition building**](/organising/coalition-building).

[Re-Amp](https://www.reamp.org/) brings together over 130 nonprofits and foundations working on climate change and energy policy across eight Midwestern states in the U.S. with the goal of reducing global-warming pollution. [Halt the Harm](https://halttheharm.net/) has built a network of 1,300 group leaders and 14,000 members across the U.S. to halt the harms of fracking in their communities. The [Power Shift network](https://powershift.org/) is a national community of organizations who work with young leaders to campaign for climate justice.

In Australia, the [Lock the Gate Alliance](https://www.lockthegate.org.au/) brings together people from across the country to protect the land, water and communities from risky coal mining, coal seam gas and fracking. [The Gasfield Free Northern Rivers](http://csgfreenorthernrivers.org/) movement brings people together to protect the biodiversity, water resources, agricultural lands and sustainable industries of the Northern Rivers from the impacts of coal seam gas and other forms of unconventional gas mining.

Several campaigns focused on privacy, censorship and surveillance in the tech world have been operating in networked coalitions including [Team Internet](https://www.battleforthenet.com/teaminternet/), which brings together nonprofits, companies and individuals to lead the [Battle for the Net](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) campaign for net neutrality, and [SaveTheLink](https://savethelink.org/) which campaigns against link censorship. Similarly, the Canadian-led [Stop Stingray Surveillance campaign](https://stopstingrays.org/) brings together NGOs and companies from multiple countries to put a stop to invasive Stingray cellphone surveillance.

[Change the Terms](https://www.changetheterms.org/), a U.S. based coalition that spans human rights, civil rights, consumer protection, and technology organizations, is fighting to reduce hateful activities online.

At the city level, three inspiring networked coalitions are [The Sydney Alliance](https://www.sydneyalliance.org.au/), which brings together over 40 religious, union and community organisations to use community organising to make Sydney a better place to live. Its global network - the Industrial Areas Foundation - does similar work in over 80 cities around the world. [Reclaim the City](http://reclaimthecity.org.za/) is a loose network of leaders and partner organisations dedicated to desegregating inner city Cape Town through radical strategies like occupations, in order to campaign for affordable housing. Finally, the Moscow City Alliance, and associated city based networks in Moscow, have campaigned in defence of green space and against demolitions, relying on the support of formal NGOs and informal local groups scattered across the city.
