## Sign-up flow

A small group of people might already be willing to become a volunteer for your organisation. All you need to do to recruit these people is to make it easy to sign up and start contributing. This is why having a good sign-up flow is important.

A sign-up flow is a visualisation of all the steps people need to take to become active: from the first time they hear about you on social media on the news, to all the clicks to get to the the signup form on your website.

## Reasons for joining

### Severeness & urgency

Before people decide to contribute to your initiative as a volunteer, they must feel like your initiative is important. The more severe and urgent they feel issue is that you are addressing, the more likely it is they will join your project.

A first step is to make clear why your initiative is needed. The second step is to show that your initiative is absolutely essential. Make sure they can no longer justify for themselves **not** becoming a volunteer. Otherwise they may decide to do something else with their life instead (focussing on their career, school, another cause, etc.).

It is all about proportionality. Your potential volunteers will ask themselves: How severe and urgent is this issue? And is my individual response proportionate? Do not tell people what to do: let them make up a personal balance.

Make sure to base your [strategy](/strategy) and [tactics](/tactics) on the severeness and urgency of the issue ([escalation ladder](https://www.nonviolence.wri-irg.org/en/node/40507?utm_source=activisthandbook.org)). If you can prove that your strategy and tactics are appropriate in the context of the cause you are working on, it will be much easier to recruit new volunteers. If not, you need to work on that first before thinking about recruiting volunteers.

### Making a real impact

Often, people feel powerless. Your movement should empower people to make a positive difference. With the right strategy and tactics, your organisation will be able to make a real impact. Show & celebrate this impact!

However, there is a dangerous pitfall! People love hearing that their contributions make a significant impact, even if it is not true. In the short term, you will be able to recruit lots of people using false promises. In the long term, though, people will become demotivated, because the change they were promised does not materialize in the real world. This is not only bad for your movement, but for all activists! People will stop believing change is possible and will stop trying.

Differentiate between small steps of progress and actual milestones.

### Networking

### Ownership

## Growing your audience

All of the above assumes you already have an audience that you can invite to sign up as volunteer. For example, people on your mailing list, website visitors, social media followers, personal network, and members of your chat groups. This audience needs to be of a significant size, because only a small number of people will actually decide to sign up if you invite them.

If you do not have enough people to ask to become volunteer, you will need to do some work to reach your potential audience first. In our [communications chapter](/communication) we explain how to do outreach & mobilization.
