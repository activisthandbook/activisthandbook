## Introduction

Consent is a collaborative decision-making method ideal for groups of around 3-8 members. It is an alternative to other methods like majority voting, consensus, autocratic, and advice process.

In consent, we make decisions when no one objects; in other words, when a proposal is 'good enough for now, safe enough to try'. This method ensures equity and effectiveness and promotes continuous improvement and learning.

## Steps

The consent decision-making process unfolds in three phases: Understand, Explore, and Decide. Each phase ensures collaborative and full participation in decision-making.

### Understand: Clarifying Questions Round

Members ask clarifying questions to fully understand the proposal.

**Example:**

_Facilitator:_ "Does anyone have any clarifying questions about the proposal to implement a new communication platform for our team?"

_Member:_ "Can you clarify how this platform will integrate with our current tools?"

### Explore: Quick Reactions Round

Members express initial reactions, focusing on feelings, concerns, and potential support.

**Example:**

_Member:_ "I feel that this new platform could streamline our communication, but I'm worried about the learning curve involved."

### Decide: Consent/Objections Round

Members seek consent or identify objections, grounding their concerns in the circle's aim.

**Example:**

_Facilitator:_ "Are there any objections to moving forward with the new communication platform, keeping in mind our aim to improve team efficiency?"

_Member:_ "I object because I believe the transition period might disrupt our workflow significantly."

#### Integrating objections

If objections arise, the proposal is revised to address concerns while aligning with the group's aim.

**Example:**

_Facilitator:_ "Let's revise the proposal to include a phased implementation plan, minimizing disruption during the transition."

## Continuous improvement

Consent decision-making is flexible and allows decisions to be revisited and adjusted as necessary, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

## Conclusion

Consent decision-making offers a dynamic and inclusive framework for collaborative decision-making. By emphasizing clarity, impartiality, and full participation, it empowers organizations and communities to make decisions that are both effective and equitable. Implementing consent decision-making in your circles fosters a culture of trust, respect, and continuous growth.
