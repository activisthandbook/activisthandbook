In that guide, we take a step back and look at the complex relations between social movements. In this guide, we focus on the practicalities of starting a collaboration in the form of a coalition.

## **Summary**

When multiple groups and organisations come together to work on a campaign, they often opt to collaborate together in a coalition.

Coalitions, however, have garnered a reputation for causing campaigners headaches due to their frequently slow, bureaucratic and top-down decision-making processes.

In this guide, we look at an alternative way of building powerful collaborative campaigns. Networked coalitions, also called ‚Äúnetworked campaigns‚Äù, harness the power of networks to develop more agile, dynamic and distributed campaigning coalitions that have proven themselves to be remarkably effective at building and channelling collective power.
