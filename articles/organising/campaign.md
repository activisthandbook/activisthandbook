In this guide, we explain how to organise a campaign. Learn how to advocate your cause with the right campaign planning. Go beyond raising awareness and make change happen.

If you're an activist who wants to make a difference, you need to know how to organise a campaign. A well-organised campaign can be the key to success, and this guide will show you how to do it. From setting goals and targetting your audience, to choosing the right tactics and organising your team, we'll cover everything you need to know to make your campaign a success.

## Steps to organise a campaign

### 1\. Get people together

Start by getting together two or three likeminded people. Having a few different perspectives will help you come up with a better strategy (the next step!). And you will soon find out that lots needs to happen, so having a few people to help you comes in handy.

Check out our organising chapter to learn more about how to mobilise more people, keep people involved, work together with other organisations, and more:

### 2\. Start strategising

Often, people who are new with activism will just start a petition or organise a protest march, without thinking too much about whether that helps them to achieve their goals. This is a mistake.

Instead, make a strategy first. Think about the following:

-   What you would like to achieve?
    
-   Who are the stakeholders?
    
-   How do we pressure decision makers to act?
    

Learn how to write your own campaign strategy:

### 3\. Choose your action tactics

Once you have figured out your strategy, you know what type of action tactics you need to choose from to make impact. Now is the time to use your creativity and start organising an action.

In our [tactics](/tactics) chapter, we help you answer questions like:

-   How do we prepare this action?
    
-   How do we make our action visually appealing?
    
-   How many people do we need for this action?
    
-   What materials do we need?
    

For inspiration, check out our list with action tactics used by activists around the globe:

### 4\. Communicate your message

You want the right people to know about your campaign. So you need to develop a communication strategy:

-   Who do we talk with?
    
-   What do we say?
    
-   What platforms do we use to share our message?
    
-   How do we create content to share?
    

Have a look at our communication chapter to learn more:

### 5\. Take care

Remember: you are in this for the long run. Do not work yourself and your fellow activists into a burnout. In our wellbeing chapter, we explain how to do activism in a healthy way. We talk about:

-   **Physical health**: for example, giving first aid at protests
    
-   **Mental health**: for example, dealing with stress
    

Learn all about group-, action- and self-care:

### 6\. Pick your digital toolset

If you are not using the right digital tools, you will soon find yourself overwhelmed with boring administrative tasks. With a good digital toolset, you will be able to do more in less time.

Check out our [tools chapter](/tools) to learn all about:

-   **Project management:** Use tools to keep track of to-do's and stay on track with your team.
    
-   **Creating a website**: Allow people to sign up for events, add forms for registering as member, share guides for your volunteers, and write content so you can be found via search engines
    
-   **Automate administrative tasks:** Use tools like Zapier or n8n to make all of your digital tools work together seamlessly.
    
-   **Digital security:** You should protect yourself and fellow change-makers from hackers. As activist, you are in a high risk group.
    
-   **_And much more!_** _For example: learn how to livesteam actions, find free stock images or record podcasts._
    

Check out our tools chapter, to find campaigning tools that are easy to use and affordable for nonprofits:

### 7\. Know your rights

Once you start making impact, you will find that your opponents start using the law to try and stop you. Don't let them. In many countries, the law provides certain protections to activists. Learn all about your legal rights:

## Q&A

### What is the difference between a protest action and a campaign?

A [protest action](/organising/protest) is a one-off event. A campaign consists of a series of actions over a longer period of time.

Often, inexperienced activists will start by organising a single protest, after which they discover that it has not led to the desired result. Then, they continue to organise more protests, without strategically thinking about how all their actions are connected.

This causes participants to be disappointed by the impact they are making with the first few protests, because they do not see how these are contributing towards the bigger picture. Effective campaigns strategically build up towards a goal.
