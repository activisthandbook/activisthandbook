## Local context

Some challenges that arise from differing local contexts across countries for activists trying to do fundraising are:

-   Disadvantageous changes in legislation or inadequate implementation of laws that restrict the freedom of association, expression or assembly of civil society organisations (CSOs) working on human rights.
    
-   Hurdles to accessing financial resources and ensuring sustainable funding, such as shrinking budgets, burdensome procedures, unfavourable tax regimes or political pressure .
    
-   Attacks and incidents against civil society activists, such as harassment, intimidation, threats, violence or smear campaigns, that create a climate of fear and insecurity.
    

Some possible solutions to these challenges are:

-   Advocating for legal reforms and effective implementation of laws that protect and promote the rights and interests of CSOs working on human rights.
    
-   Diversifying the sources of funding and seeking alternative or innovative ways of fundraising, such as crowdfunding, social enterprises or membership fees .
    
-   Building solidarity and cooperation among CSOs and other stakeholders, such as media, academia, public institutions or international organisations, to raise awareness and support for human rights activism.
