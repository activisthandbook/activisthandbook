**In this article, you will learn how the buddy system works during protests. Activists can benefit from the buddy system to feel safer during actions.**

-   If one of you wants to leave the action, you all leave, no questions asked
    

The buddy system is a procedure in which two individuals, the "buddies", operate together as a single unit so that they are able to monitor and help each other. As per Merriam-Webster, the first known use of the phrase "buddy system" goes as far back as 1942. [Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buddy%20system) goes on to define the buddy system as "an arrangement in which two individuals are paired (as for mutual safety in a hazardous situation).‚Äù The buddy system is basically working together in pairs in a large group or alone. Both the individuals have to do the job. The job could be to ensure that the work is finished safely or the skill/learning is transferred effectively from one individual to the other.
