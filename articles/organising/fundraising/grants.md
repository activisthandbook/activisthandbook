**In this article, you will learn how to apply for grants to support your cause. We have made a list of grants for nonprofit organisations and activist movements.**

There are a number of grants available for activists who are working to make a difference in their communities. These grants can provide funding for a variety of activities, including community organising, advocacy and international collaboration. Grants can be a great way to support the work of activists, and there are a number of organisations that provide grant funding for activists.

## Grant writing

> This section is not done yet. Do you know a thing or two about grant writing? Share your experience with activists around the globe!

## Improve this page

You can make this page about grants for activists better! Here are some suggestion:

-   **Add more organisations to the list of funding sources.** If you know local funding opportunities, add them to the appropriate country section.
    
-   Once the list with funding sources belongs a bit too long for one page, we could split it up into separate pages for each region.
