In this guide, we explain how to get people energized again during meetings and workshops. We have listed games for groups of all sizes.

> üìö This guide is part of a series on [**how to facilitate meetings**](https://activisthandbook.org/organising/facilitating).

## Introduction

When people stop concentrating or become irritable in a meeting, this could simply be because they've been sitting and listening for too long. A stretch or a game can re-energise people. Games can change the atmosphere in other ways - from lifting the spirits in the group to creating a quieter, more contemplative mood. They provide an opportunity for people to use their brains and bodies in a different way - which may be more refreshing than a simple rest.

Be sensitive to the group and individual members - the idea is to relax people, not for them to feel embarrassed or isolated. Don't coerce people into playing games. If people don't feel like playing, they could get themselves a drink or go outside for fresh air.

There are lots of energisers and ice-breakers to be found on the internet. We have prioritised games which aren't competitive - or if they are, where we think that individuals are unlikely to feel singled out as 'losers', or feel they are the reason their team lost. We have included some very short exercises for occasions when there's no time to play a full game.We have chosen exercises to work for a range of different access requirements, in the hope that you can pick something suitable for your group.

It can help to think through how you will make games accessible in advance, so you don't get stuck trying to adapt an exercise on the go. Sometimes a short break or a pause to stretch can enable everyone to do for themselves whatever they need to do. This may seem less exciting than a game, but could be better than a 'fun activity' that only some people can participate in!

## **Shake down 5-4-3-2-1**

**Any number of people; 1-2 minutes**

This very short energiser works well to get people's energy up quickly - or to calm them down if they have tension to release! It doesn't involve physical contact, or too much 'looking silly'.

### **Process**

1.  Everyone shakes their left arm five times, counting to five along with each shake. Model doing this enthusiastically to help people get into it.
    
2.  Repeat with the other arm, then each leg.
    
3.  Repeat, with each limb four times. Then three, and so on down to one.
    

Of course, this could also be done starting at 10, for example if people are very cold and need the exercise! Or once people are familiar with it, you could count down from three for an even quicker exercise.

## **Shake all hands**

**10-30 people; 1 minute**

This exercise gets energy levels up, and helps people to start interacting, without taking much time at all. It can be especially useful at the start of a workshop or meeting.

Give people a short time limit to shake hands with everyone in the room - usually about one second for each person present. For most people this involves getting up out of their seat. Invite anyone who needs to to stay in their seats, and remind the people standing up that they will need to go to those people to shake their hands.

### **Variations**

Not everyone is comfortable with hand-shaking. Asking people to 'high five' each other could be a less intense variant. Or for no physical contact at all, just ask people to greet everyone in the room. In some groups, a nice variant could be for everyone to do the greeting in their own first language.

## **Bombs and shields**

This quick and popular energiser gets people moving around the space. Each person (privately) selects one other individual in the room to be their 'bomb', and another to be their 'shield'. When you say go, people start to move around, trying to keep their shield between themself and their 'bomb' at all times.

### **Things to be aware of**

We have included this exercise under the heading of 'bombs and shields' because that is the name that people are most likely to recognise for the game. However, not everyone will want to play a light-hearted game involving imaginary bombs! Try looking for alternative language that is appropriate for your group. For example, we've known hunt saboteur groups using 'hounds, foxes and hunt sabs'.

## **Count to ten**

**10 minutes; 5 - 20 people**

An excellent game for focusing people and getting them to work together. It creates laughter and energy without requiring movement or physical contact.

With everyone sitting or standing in a circle, explain that they have to count upwards - set a target (usually 10) if you like. Only one person can say any one number. If at any stage two or more people speak simultaneously the group have to go back to 1 and start again. Nor can the same person say more than one number in succession. Some groups will discover a way to 'cheat' (e.g. co-ordinate who speaks using gestures). You could acknowledge their co-operative skills, and then ask them to try again with a twist. For example, ask them to shut their eyes, or turn their backs so they can't see each other!

## **Rain making**

**5 minutes; 1‚Äì100 people**

This is a lovely co-operative game that always brings a group together and lights up people's faces!

### **Process**

1.  Ask everyone to gather around you in a tight semi-circle, several people deep.
    
2.  Divide the semi-circle into three groups. Explain that you're all going to create a rainstorm by making four simple sounds in a round. The sounds are as follows...
    

-   Drizzle - gently rub your palms together to produce a whispering sound.
    
-   Light rain - move your hands up and down in opposite directions, with the palms brushing against each other, as if you are brushing sand off the palms.
    
-   Heavy rain - clap your hands together.
    
-   Hail - cup your palms and clap them against your thighs.
    

1.  Start off group one on making drizzle. Once that's under way turn and signal to group two to start with drizzle, then group three.
    
2.  Turn back to group 1 and get them to start light rain whilst the other maintain their drizzle, then turn to group two and do the same, then group three.
    
3.  Keep the round alive until all segments are making hail. Then work backwards so that group one stop hailing and make heavy rain, then two, then three, until you work back through light rain to drizzle and then silence!
    

## **Knot game**

**10 minutes; 10 - 20 people**

Another whole group co-operative problem-solving game with an element of physical contact.

Everyone stands in a circle with their eyes closed. They move towards the centre of the circle with outstretched hands. Each person finds another hand for each of theirs. Then they open their eyes, and unravel the knot without opening hands.

Make two simultaneous groups if there is a large number of people.

## **Wizards, pixies, giants**

**10 minutes; 10 - 100 people**

A fun physical team version of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'!

### **Process**

-   Sort the group into two teams and explain that each team has to choose one of three options - Wizards, Pixies, or Giants.
    
-   Demonstrate the action for each choice. Wizards move forward and use their arms to 'zap' their opponents (and of course say "Zap!" as they do so). Pixies bend down low and scurry around in circles quickly whilst chattering to themselves in high-pitched gibberish. Giants move forward and raise themselves to their full height (arms stretched above their heads, hands clawed) and they roar. Obviously.
    
-   Get the teams to huddle together and give them a minute or two to agree their choice.
    
-   They stand facing each other across the room, and on your count of "One...Two..." they take two steps forward. On the count of ‚ÄúThree...‚Äù they do their thing, be it wizardly, pixie like or gigantic.
    
-   Work out who has won, based on the following scoring:
    
    -   Wizards 'zap' all known Pixies and they fall asleep.
        
    -   Pixies scurry round giants legs distracting them.
        
    -   Giants overpower wizards by stomping around them.
        
-   Play enough rounds for a clear winner to emerge, or until laughing begins to hurt. One variation sees the winning team chase the losers. Any losers that are touched before they get to the safety of their starting point join the winning team. The game is won when one team captures all of the other.
    

## **Body part twister**

**5 minutes; 5 - 20 people**

Great for getting people working together and energised. It is physical and needs people to be comfortable leaning on each other.

### **Process**

1.  Call out different body parts, these are the only parts of the body the whole group can have touching the floor.
    
2.  Encourage people to work together to find a solution and balance on each other if they need to. For example, to a group of nine people you could call out four bums, two feet, one head, two hands, four knees.
    
3.  Call out the next set of instructions as soon as everyone is in position.
    

Think before you call out combinations or you could call out something that is physically or numerically impossible!

## **Pass a loop round the circle**

**3 - 15 people; 3 - 10 minutes**

A physical, co-operative challenge that doesn't take too long. It relies on everyone in the group having a degree of flexibility and movement control.

Ask the group to hold hands in a circle. One person starts with a loop of rope or string diagonally across their body (i.e. resting on on the shoulder on one side, and below the arm on the other side.) The task is to pass the loop around the circle without letting go off hands - people twist and wiggle in order to to pass it on to the next person. It is possible for people to help each other, for example stretching out the loop with their foot so it's easier for someone to get out of it. This can involve going into someone's personal space more than simply holding hands, so you could set a ground rule that people ask first.

### **Things to be aware of**

Not everyone is comfortable holding hands, so pre-warn people, and offer an alternative game or an observer option if not everyone wants physical contact. This game also requires some degree of flexibility and movement control from everyone in the circle.

## **Shrinking islands**

**8-10 people; 10 minutes**

This is a co-operative game which is suitable for groups where everyone is comfortable with quite a lot of physical contact. It is quite physical, so may not work for anyone who has an injury or bad back they need to take care of.

### **Process**

1.  Place a large sheet of paper on the floor, and instruct the group to stand on it, without any part of their body touching the floor or the walls.
    
2.  When the group succeeds at this, they step off the paper, and you shrink it - either by tearing some off, or folding it in half.
    
3.  Repeat, until the challenge becomes too difficult. If anyone in your group uses a wheelchair, make sure there is always space for all the wheels! As the paper gets smaller, the group will need to problem solve, e.g. by standing on each others feet, climbing on each others shoulders, or placing just one foot in the middle and then supporting each other to lean out.
    

### **Variation**

In a bigger group you can divide people up into smaller groups, each with their own paper. This is often done by making it into a competition for which team can fit on the smallest paper. However, there is no reason why the small groups can't just do the challenge independently, without comparing themselves to the others.

## **Bed-sheet ping pong**

This is a competitive team game, that can be played with everyone sitting or standing.

Divide the group into 2 teams. Each team takes one end of a double bed sheet and holds it stretched out flat in the air.

Drop a ping pong ball onto the sheet. The task of each team is to manipulate the sheet so that the ball drops off the other team's end - and to prevent it from dropping off their end.

You could play 'first to three', or see which team has most points in a set time frame. Or don't don't bother with counting scores at all, and just finish when you think people have had enough!

## **Pass the squeeze**

**5 minutes; 10 - 30 people**

This game is mildly competitive - but in teams so no individual is singled out as winner or loser.

### **Process**

1.  Arrange the participants in parallel two lines of equal length. They can be sat down on either side of a long table, or simply in chairs facing each other. Everyone closes their eyes.
    
2.  At one end of the lines, arrange a bottle or other object so it is equally reachable by the two end people. (If there is no shared table, you could put the object in reach on a side-table or up-turned box.)
    
3.  At the other end, the facilitator, (or a participant, if you have odd numbers), simultaneously squeezes the hands of the two people with free hands. They 'pass on' the squeeze all the way down each line, until it gets to the final people. They can then open their eyes and grab the object. The team to grab the object first 'wins'.
    
4.  The two object-grabbers then go back to the opposite end of the line, and everyone moves down so that the next two can take their turn. Or if shunting sideways into the next chair isn't easy for everyone and you have plenty of space, the end people could move to the far end of the line, but the object simply be moved nearer to the next people.
    

## **Lower a bamboo cane to the ground**

**6-14 people; 10 minutes**

This co-operative challenge is harder than it sounds! It is suitable for a group where everyone is able to stand and bend/squat down easily.

The group stands in a line, with their arms out, pointing their index fingers. Lay a light-weight bamboo cane on the fingers, and let them adjust their arm heights until the cane is level. Their task is to lower the cane to the ground, with the cane completely level, and everyone's fingers in contact with it at all times. People can't grab the cane, it should simply rest on their fingers. If ever the cane tilts out of balance, or someone's finger loses contact, they need to start again at the beginning.

NB: with a heavier stick (e.g. mop handle) the game will be too easy, it is the lightness of the cane which provides the challenge.
