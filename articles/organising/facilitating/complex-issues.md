In this guide, you will learn how to discuss complex issues during a meeting. We discuss various techniques used by experienced facilitators.

> üìö This guide is part of a series on [**how to facilitate meetings**](https://activisthandbook.org/organising/facilitating).

Here are some tools that are useful when dealing with challenging issues in the group. They are designed to bring issues into the open, and help people express themselves and be heard. Bear in mind that working with conflict requires both skill and experience. One option is to stop the meeting and seek help from experienced facilitators, such as those at [**Activist Mediation Network**](http://activistmediation.org.uk/)

## **Fish bowl**

A small number of people participate in a discussion, while everyone else watches and listens. This allows for a more naturally flowing and in depth conversation than is possible when everyone is contributing at once. It creates a space where some people will find it easier to say things in front of the whole group. This means it can sometimes be used to explore a contentious issue. There is an option for audience members to 'swap in' if they want to join the conversation.

### **Process**

1.  Set up a smaller circle of chairs within the main circle, facing in.
    
2.  Set up any ground-rules. For example, if you are allowing audience members to 'swap in' to the discussion, we suggest that there is always one empty chair. When someone sits in the empty chair, someone else has to go and join the audience circle - but at least each person gets to decide for themself whether it is a good moment for them to leave.
    
3.  Explain the topic of the discussion. Give enough time for questions. Then the first people volunteer to go into the fishbowl. Sometimes you might ask the audience to wait for a period of time before they can start swapping in. Allow the conversation to flow, with people swapping in to bring new perspectives.
    
4.  If the fishbowl brought up strong feelings, you may need to give people a way to process and discharge them afterwards. This is especially the case if some people spent their whole time in the fishbowl, and the others were 'audience' throughout. Examples of ‚Äòdischarge‚Äô activities could include shaking and stretching, a short break, chatting in pairs, or a combination of all three.
    

### **Things to be aware of**

Being part of a small group in the middle may make it easier for some people to voice things they wouldn't usually say in front of the whole group. This could be helpful, but it could also lead to people saying more than they would have chosen to. Other people may find the fishbowl set up very exposing, and so be less likely to join in. It can be good to build trust in the group before using a fishbowl for contentious topics.

Consider mobility issues if you are asking people to swap in and out. Simple adaptations we can think of are: leaving a gap in the inner circle of seats, so that a wheelchair-user can join the fishbowl; creating an exception so that someone who finds it difficult to get up and move places can join from their 'audience' seat.

## **Controlled dialogue**

**30 minutes - 1 hour; 3 people per group**

This tool is helpful when two people find it difficult to listen to each other and understand each other's concerns. Their conversation goes through three stages, each with a different 'rule'. The aim of this very structured exercise is to establish more careful listening. The rules gradually relax as the listening improves.

### **Process**

Form a group of three, one observer and two speakers/listeners. The observer makes sure participants stick to the format and helps out if necessary.

**Stage one**: The first speaker talks on an issue. They should focus on essential points because listening will require a lot of concentration. The listener repeats word for word what the speaker has said. Only then are they allowed to answer.

**Stage two**: The listener summarises what the speaker has said and then answers.

**Stage three**: When answering the listener addresses all issues and concerns of the speaker.

### **Things to be aware of**

Often the reason that people can't hear each other very well, is that they are feeling upset and angry - not that they don't have the skills to listen. In this situation, a structured conversation with a lot of rules may not be what people most need! Make sure people understand how the tool will work, and only use it if both people are genuinely willing.

## **Sharing withholds**

**15 - 40 minutes; 5 - 30 people**

Withholds are thoughts that we keep to ourselves. They usually have to do with judgements about ourselves, others, or what is happening in the group. For this tool to work there needs to be a culture of listening to and accepting each other, which may take some time to achieve. It may be helpful if the group commits to putting aside enough time to relax together and do this exercise.

Set up an unstructured round asking people to make statements beginning with: ‚ÄúIf I could change one thing in the group it would be...‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat upsets me about this group is ...‚Äù. Do not allow anyone to respond to the withholds or start a discussion. Make sure that everyone has a say - it is highly unlikely that someone is completely happy with a group. At the end of the round, see if any themes have emerged and if anyone wants their issue discussed.

## **Feelings meeting**

**30 minutes - 2 hours; 3 - 30 people**

A meeting which is solely concerned with feelings. Many groups hold regular feelings meetings to catch any problems early. Participants do not have to deal with decisions and actions. Such meetings allow the group to involve and support members as whole people and to resolve concerns, problems and conflicts before they become too serious. It helps to use tools such as talking sticks or go-rounds to encourage active listening.

Encourage people to speak for themselves, rather than assuming that others share their feelings. Begin by asking people about where they are at in their lives outside the group. This will give a context for everyone's reactions when you come on to issues within the group. Listen for what is not being said. For example, some people and groups find it hard to admit to negative feelings and tiptoe around conflicts. Create a safe enough space so that people feel able to open up.

## **Spectrum lines**

**20 minutes to 1 hour; 5 - 100 people**

These can help to explore the different views or needs around an issue within the group. People in a group place themselves somewhere along a physical line to show how strongly they agree or disagree with a statement.

**Controversial topics**: Spectrum lines are often used to bring differences of opinion into the open. In an ordinary conversation, people might not speak up if they think the rest of the group won't agree with them. In a spectrum line, you get an indication where everyone in the group is at - which can then be the starting point for more discussion.

**Personal needs and preferences**: Spectrum lines can be used in a similar way to explore more personal differences, for example what needs people have from a shared work or living space.

**Gauging commitment to different ideas**: If you have several possible ideas on the table, spectrum lines can help you work out which ones people have most energy for. This may show up a clear favourite. Alternatively it could be a springboard for more exploration, e.g. 'What would we need to change about this idea to increase your level of commitment?'

### **Process**

1.  Create an imaginary or real line through the room (chalk or masking tape on the floor are good for indoor spaces). Mark one end with ‚ÄúI agree completely‚Äù, the other end for ‚ÄúI disagree completely‚Äù. You could also use a curved line so that people can see each other.
    
2.  Outline the issue under debate and formulate it into a statement to agree or disagree with. Ask people to position themselves along the line according to their views. They may try out several spots before making a final choice.
    
3.  Ask them to have a short conversation with the person next to them, explaining why they are where they are.
    
4.  Invite participants to share their viewpoints and feelings with the group. Repeat this exercise with other statements that explore the issue under discussion and see whether and how people‚Äôs viewpoints change.
    

### **Things to be aware of**

**Controversial topics**: This tool can have the impact of 'stirring people up' on a topic, so think about whether that will be helpful, and whether you are well-placed to help people navigate any conflicts. It also makes differences very visible. This could be difficult for anyone who feels isolated in their opinions, or is anxious about being judged. This would be particularly the case in a situations where people got status for particular opinions, e.g. because they were seen as more 'radical' or more 'committed'.

**Physical considerations**: If a spectrum line involves long discussions people can end up standing for a long time, which won't be comfortable/possible for everyone. Unless you have a lot of space, people can also end up quite cramped together, which could make it harder for someone to manoeuvre their wheelchair around. Adapt the exercise to suit the people and space you have. For example, you could scatter chairs around the room for people who need to sit down. Or you could give people the option to contribute from their existing chair - it's good if you have at least two people doing this, so they have someone to talk to during the 'chat to someone near you' stage!

## **Roleplays**

**10 minutes - 3 hours; 5 - 100 people**

Roleplay involves people acting out a scenario, to explore different reactions and practise skills. They could take on a specific role, that involves acting as someone else (for example police officers at a protest). Alternatively, they could simply participate in the scenario as if it were happening to them.

### **Example**

If you are helping people prepare for a demonstration, you could ask someone to roleplay a person whose journey was delayed by all the crowds in the street. Spend time exploring what might be going on for this person, and practising different ways of responding. This can be much more powerful that simply talking about how you'd react in different scenarios.

### **Process**

#### Stage 1: Running the scenario

1.  Select a situation to be played out. Ask yourself what you want to explore and why. It should be relatively simple, so that people can get their heads round it quickly.
    
2.  Explain the situation carefully, including the groups represented (e.g. police and protesters) and the physical layout. If you need people to take on particular roles ask them to volunteer, and always leave open the option of people observing.
    
3.  Give people a few minutes to get into their roles. Ask everyone who is not playing to be active observers.
    
4.  Start the scenario. Run it until enough issues have been uncovered, the exercise comes to a natural end or people want to stop. The play should also be stopped if a participant shows great tension or gets too involved. If there is likely to be a lot of noise, consider using a whistle, bell or musical instrument as a stop signal.
    
5.  Allow people to 'de-role'. This means stepping away from the part they were playing and getting into a different headspace. How much de-roling you have to do depends on the intensity of the roleplay. Options include a simple shake, a few deep breaths, swapping seats, taking a break, a physical game, or a visualisation that takes people's attention elsewhere (to a pleasant memory, for example). If the scenario brought up strong feelings, you could invite people to do 'feelings debriefs' in pairs, before moving on to whole group evaluation.
    

#### Stage 2: Evaluating the scenario

This gives participants and observers the chance to reflect on and learn from what has happened.

1.  Start by asking the players how they felt in their roles. Ask observers for their impressions.
    
2.  Then allow broader discussion. What have people learnt and how will they apply their insights in real life? Discourage comments that tell participants what they should have done. Compliment people for having the courage to participate regardless of how the scenario turned out. These tools are there for learning. Use encouraging language such as ‚ÄúAnother option that you might try is...‚Äù, ‚Äú Perhaps this would work...‚Äù, ‚ÄúI learned ... from your tactic and would like to try...‚Äù.
    
3.  If new insights come up the group might want to try them out in a new exercise rather than talk about what might happen.
    

### **Things to be aware of**

**Exposure**: For some people, roleplay can be embarrassing, especially if they are being watched by the rest of the group. Some people will find it more difficult to play a part than to act as themself - and vice versa! It can help to start with paired or small group role-plays, where people get to participate without feeling like there is an audience. Roleplay with the whole group could be done with one or two people volunteering to take on parts, and everyone else participating as themselvesor observing.

**Misrepresenting people**: Roleplay can be a powerful tool for feeling your way into someone else's perspective. At the same time, there is a risk that asking people to imagine someone else's perspective could end up reproducing stereotypes, hurting other participants‚Äô feelings or just not be very realistic. In particular, avoid situations where people role-play members of a marginalised group they aren't part of. Ask yourself:

-   Is roleplay the most appropriate tool? Could you find out about different perspectives by finding people in the group who can talk about their own experiences?
    
-   How can you help people prepare so the roleplay is as useful as possible? Can you ask people to reflect on relevant similar experiences they've actually had? Or give them information to help them (e.g. common police tactics for people role-playing cops).
    

**Strong feelings**: Roleplay can bring up lots of emotion. This gives depth to learning, but can also make it harder to move on if people don't get a chance to process those feelings. Allow enough time to get out of role. Be aware that a specific role play will affect people in different ways.

For more on using roleplay, see our guide on [**Facilitating Workshops**](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/facilitatingworkshops).

## **Paired roleplay**

This is a simple and quick variation of roleplay. It is sometimes called ‚Äòhassle lines‚Äô or ‚Äòparallel lines‚Äô. It is a great tool for:

-   people exploring their emotional responses to a situation
    
-   looking at body language
    
-   preparing for a particular situation such as aggression from the public or the police during a protest or action
    

As with any role play, make it clear that anyone who isn't comfortable participating is welcome to act as an observer.

### **Process**

1.  Usually, participants form two lines, each facing a partner. The two lines are given roles and a brief scenario. The left line, for example, may take on the role of protesters, the other side of unsympathetic passers-by, making a provocative comment such as ‚ÄúGet a job‚Äù.
    
2.  Start the scenario. The two lines move towards each other and play their roles.
    
3.  After a short time (30 seconds to two minutes) the facilitator stops the roleplay and asks a few people for their comments, e.g. what they did and how they felt. Roles can then be swapped and scenarios varied.
    

### **Variation**

The format of two lines and people moving towards each other at the start can increase the adrenaline, which may help people get into it. For a calmer mood, pairs could simply find a space, and begin when they are ready.
