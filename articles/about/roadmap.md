On this page, you will find the roadmap of Activist Handbook.

## Ideas

### Website 3.0

Functionality:

-   A better, more prominent, search engine
    
-   More prominent edit button, and button to add external resources
    
-   Redefined primary call to action, based on needs of website visitors instead of needs Activist Handbook, for example:
    
    -   Get training in \[My City\]
        
    -   Our best guides in your inbox
        
-   External resources as database items (searchable)
    
    -   Evaluate resource quality score based on criteria
        
-   Custom design so other organisations can 'claim' a page
    
-   Collaborative editor
    

Tech stack:

-   Nuxt
    
-   Daisy UI
