We want to encourage _people of all backgrounds_ to unite and stand up for justice. On this platform, people from all around the world share their experiences as activists. We welcome everyone to contribute to our shared knowledge base on activism.

We pledge to stick to the following principles, and ask everyone who joins our community to do so as well:

1.  All our content is **freely accessible** and **reusable**.
    
2.  We are **inclusive**, **emancipatory** and **progressive**. Diversity is our strength. **We do not tolerate** hate, racism, ageism, ​GSRM-phobia (_phobia for Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities_), sexism, ableism or prejudice based on ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, gender presentation, language ability, asylum status or religious affiliation.
    
3.  We **scientifically obtain** and **share our knowledge**. We use proper attribution and referencing.
    
4.  **Privacy is a core value**. We collect as little data as possible and we handle any data we collect with care.
    
5.  We stay financially independent. **Money cannot buy our support**. We only recommend **tools** and **services that we use and like**. We are **transparent** about our funding sources.
    
6.  We **critically reflect on ourselves** and facilitate **safe spaces** for **open dialogues**.
    

## Radical transparency

We share who we are and what we do in a radically transparent way. Our documents are publicly available, we share recordings of our meetings and all our finances are open out there for everyone to see.

Our goal is clear: we are here to train rebels to challenge the status quo, and we are not afraid to tell the world all about it. However, _this does not mean we do not care about privacy, quite the contrary._

## Discussion

As part of our sixth principle, our principles _are not set in stone_. Although they form the cornerstone of what Activist Handbook is, we always allow for open debates so that we can finetune our moral compass. Currently, the following discussion is still ongoing:

-   [Non-violence](/discussion/violence): In what way should we discuss the use of violence by activists?
