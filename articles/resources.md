## Resources for activists

We made a collection of valuable resources for protestors, campaigners and all other social change-makers:

-   **🔗** [**Websites**](/resources/websites)
    
-   **📕** [**Books**](/resources/books)
    
-   📖 [**Handbooks**](/resources/handbooks)
    
-   **🎧** [**Podcasts**](/resources/podcasts)
    
-   **🎬** [**Films and documentaries**](/resources/films-documentaries)
    
-   **🎓** [**Scientific research**](/resources/scientific-research)
    
-   **📝** [**Articles and blogs**](/resources/articles-and-blogs)
    

> If you would like to learn more about mobilising, movement-building and organising protests, make sure to check out the rest of [Activist Handbook](/).

## Improve this page

Feel free to add resources about activism on this page. Please make sure the resource follows the following guidelines:

-   **The resource is about activism in general**. If there is a page on this website that is more related, add it on that page. For example, a resource on how to organise a protest march fits better on the page about [protest marches](/tactics/march). This way it becomes easier to find the right resources. If you are unsure where to place a resource, add it to the comments!
    
-   **Resources in other languages should be added to the resource pages of those languages, unless there are translations or subtitles available.** If no resources page exists for your language yet, you can create it yourself.
    
-   **Summarise what the resource is about.** Add (if applicable) the author, the year of publication, and a brief summary of the contents of the resource.
    
-   **Whenever possible, link to the website of the original author, instead of websites like Amazon.** We are not here to help these monopolists get better search engine results.
