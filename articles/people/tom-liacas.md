Tom is a networked advocacy specialist with over 20 yearsâ€™ experience in innovation management and knowledge transfer.

Though he first cut his teeth as Campaigns Manager with global counter-culture agents at Adbusters, Tom also spent time in the private sector, where he co-founded a publicly-traded digital agency, gained unique experience leading online stakeholder dialogue projects and designed patented evaluation systems.

As he came to his senses and refocused his career on progressive social change, Tom worked as a consultant, trainer, coach and facilitator with NGOs in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. As a researcher and analyst, he has released several reports on emerging movement-building practices and publishes frequently in the Stanford Social Innovation Review and with Mobilisation Lab.

To help progressive "justice-oriented" activists build up their power and capacities, Tom has founded several support projects including the Blueprints for Change collaborative guide-writing collective, the Climate Justice Organizing HUB and the Global Grassroots Support Network (GGSN).
