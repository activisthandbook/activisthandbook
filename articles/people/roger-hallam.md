**Julian Roger Hallam** (born 4 May 1966)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-1) is a British environmental activist, a co-founder of [Extinction Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion),[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-thetimes-leake-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-3) [cooperative federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_federation) organisation [Radical Routes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Routes)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-4) and the political party [Burning Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Pink).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-guardian-5)

## Biography

Hallam was raised by a Methodist family.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-6) He was previously an [organic farmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming) on a 10-acre (4-hectare) [smallholding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallholding) near [Llandeilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llandeilo) in [South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales); he attributes the destruction of his business to a series of [extreme weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather) events.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-independent-cockburn-8)

Between at least 2017 and early 2019 he was studying for a PhD at [King's College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_College_London),[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-guardian-laville-9) researching how to achieve social change through [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience) and radical movements.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-bbc-nye-10)

In January 2017, in an action to urge King's College London to [divest from fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_divestment), Hallam and another person, David Durant, using water-soluble chalk-based spray paint,[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-independent-cockburn-8) painted "Divest from oil and gas", "Now!" and "Out of time" on the university's Strand campus entrance.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-times-humphries-11)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-guardian-laville-9) and were fined £500.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-independent-broomfield-12) In February they again spray painted the university's Great Hall causing a claimed £7,000 worth of damage and were arrested.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-times-humphries-11)

In May 2019, after a three-day trial at [Southwark Crown Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwark_Crown_Court) for criminal damage, they were cleared by a jury of all charges, having argued in their defence that their actions were a [proportionate response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_in_English_criminal_law) to the [climate crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis), with Hallam arguing his actions were lawful under an exemption in the Criminal Damage Act that permits damage if it protects another's property.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-guardian-laville-9)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-13) In March 2017, Hallam went on [hunger strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_strike) to demand the university divest from fossil fuels—the institution had millions of pounds invested in fossil fuels but no investment in [renewable energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy).[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-independent-broomfield-12) Five weeks after the first protest, the university removed £14m worth of investments from [fossil fuel companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel#Energy_sector) and pledged to become [carbon neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutral) by 2025.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-independent-cockburn-8)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-14)

Later in 2017, Hallam was a leading member of activist group Stop Killing Londoners,[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-Guardian_17-12-27-15) an anti-pollution campaign[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-16) of mass civil disobedience that they hoped would result in the arrest and imprisonment of activists.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-17) Hallam with Stuart Basden and two others were prosecuted and some pledged to go on hunger strike if imprisoned.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-Guardian_17-11-07-18)

Hallam is a co-founder of environmental pressure group [Extinction Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion), with [Gail Bradbrook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Bradbrook) and Simon Bramwell.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-thetimes-leake-2)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-bbc-nye-10)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-19)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-20) He stood unsuccessfully in the [2019 European Parliament election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Parliament_election_in_the_United_Kingdom) in the [London constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_(European_Parliament_constituency)) as an independent, winning 924 of the 2,241,681 votes cast (0.04%).[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-21)

Hallam was interviewed by [Stephen Sackur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Sackur) on BBC [_HARDtalk_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HARDtalk) on 15 August 2019.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-sackur-2019-22)

Hallam and four other activists were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance on 12 September 2019, the day before a planned action to pilot [drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadcopter) in the exclusion zone around [Heathrow Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport) in order to disrupt flights.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-23) Three days later, in an action organised by Heathrow Pause, Hallam was arrested in the vicinity of Heathrow Airport apparently in breach of bail conditions from the previous arrest requiring him to not to be within 5 miles (8 kilometres) of any airport or possess drone equipment.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-24) He was remanded in custody until 14 October.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-25)

In an interview with [_Die Zeit_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Zeit) on 20 November 2019, Hallam said genocides are "like a regular event" in history and called the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) "just another fuckery in human history".[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-26)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-guardian-ct-27) This comment was made in the context of a broader discussion on genocides throughout human history, where Hallam compared the Nazi Holocaust to the [Congo genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congolese_Genocide); as he stated the "fact of the matter is, millions of people have been killed in vicious circumstances on a regular basis throughout history" adding that the Belgians "went to the Congo in the late 19th century and decimated it."[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-28) Hallam's controversial comparison has drawn support from African activists the Stop the Maangamizi: We Charge Genocide/[Ecocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecocide)! Campaign, who, while critical of the tone of his language, have lauded his honesty and willingness to highlight crimes committed by colonial powers in Africa.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-smwecgec-gapp-29)

In a self-published pamphlet written in prison, Hallam wrote that the climate crisis would lead to mass rape, and featured a story in which the reader's female family members are gang raped and the reader forced to watch. The pamphlet was condemned by Farah Nazeer, CEO of [Women's Aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Aid).[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-30) When [_Der Spiegel_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Spiegel) replied to Hallam that "You can't blame the climate change for the rape of women during war", Hallam's response was "No, climate change is just the tubes that the gas comes down in the gas chamber. It's just a mechanism through which one generation kills the next generation".[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hallam_(activist)#cite_note-31)
