In this guide, we explain what kind of content we want to see on Activist Handbook.

## Practical 'how to' guides

All our guides answer a question that starts with: **"How to..."**

For example:

-   How to organise a protest?
    
-   How to keep people involved?
    
-   How to reach more people using social media?
    

Keep in mind **your audience**: _activists all over the globe, fighting for various causes_

## Allowed on Activist Handbook

### **Allowed: Original research**

Original content is used to mean anything that is published **_for the first time_** on _Activist Handbook,_ which therefore does not exist previously anywhere else.

The primary aim of _Activist Handbook_ is to research, collect, categorise and share information useful to activists, by making it available and easy for consultation all in one place. Material that has **already been published** through publications, toolkits, on other organisations’ websites etc will therefore be the priority focus of content uploaded on and shared through the Activist Handbook’s website.

However, unlike Wikipedia, Activist Handbook also allows the publication of original research. Why do we do this? Activism is a relatively unexplored area academically: **sometimes the best source is you**.

Activist Handbook values personal experiences of activists and strives to gradually create a space where activists benefit through a peer-to-peer exchange process.

On Activist Handbook, everyone can share lessons they learned while doing activism. It is a collaborative platform for doing research together.

Be aware that anyone can edit your text: unlike regular academic research, on Activist Handbook you do not publish under your own name. This means that others cannot respond or refer to your work specifically when building upon it. Instead, they edit it directly to improve your text. This requires a certain discipline: you should **never remove the perspectives of other authors**. Instead, add an additional section that discusses the same topic from a different perspective. **The end result reads like a guide as if it is written by a single author** (who happens to be unrealistically knowledgeable with a great ability to self-reflect).

### **Allowed: Writing about yourself**

Unlike Wikipedia, for example, we encourage contributors to write about topics they are close to. For example, we believe that people of a particular marginalised identity are the best people to write about making activism accessible for their communities. Also, activists in a particular organisation are the people best placed to write about that organisation.

However, we should also be wary of the effect of being close to a subject we are writing about. For example, members of a particular organisation should be wary of unduly promoting that organisation when writing about them. When you’re writing, ask yourself, would this perspective be controversial in a circle of activists from other progressive organisations? If so, present their perspectives too.

In addition, we encourage you to add a disclaimer to the "improve this page", something in the lines of:

> This guide was largely written by people who are a member of XYZ. We encourage others to share their outsider's perspectives.
