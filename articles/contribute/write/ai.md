In this guide, we explain how you can use ChatGPT and similar tools to write better guides for activists. We show you what prompts to use and warn for its limitations.

## Using ChatGPT

We recommend you to download the Edge browser to use ChatGPT for free (unlimited).

In the top right corner of your Edge browser window, you will find a blue chat button. Once you have clicked that button, a sidebar will appear on the right side of the window.

-   Use the **chat** feature if you want Edge get information from the web, or to use the page you are currently viewing.
    
-   Use the **compose** feature if you want to generate text (usually works best for the prompts on this page).
