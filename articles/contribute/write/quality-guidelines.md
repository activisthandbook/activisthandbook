In this guide, we explain how Activist Handbook evaluates the quality of the guides on our website. We also use these same guidelines for external resources. As a writer, you can use these to write better guides.

## Why do we have guidelines?

Our quality guidelines help us clearly communicate with our readers what to expect from the guides they are reading. We use these guidelines both to evaluate our own guides, as well as external resources.

## How to use these guidelines?

These guidelines are meant to allow you to **quickly** determine the quality of a guide. Each of these evaluation criteria are either **fail** or **pass**. Guides receive a 1 to 5 score based on the percentage of passing criteria.

> **⚠️ Important**:
> 
> At Activist Handbook, **_we publish any guide, regardless of the quality score_**, as long as they fulfil our topic criteria (it must be a practical how-to guide).
> 
> In fact, we [encourage](/contribute/write/improve#do-not-go-for-perfect) writers not to go for perfect. It is fine to publish a draft. This lowers the barrier for people to contribute. And it allows people to write together.
> 
> Our quality score helps readers understand what to expect from a guide.
