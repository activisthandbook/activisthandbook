**Sexual assault and harassment are happening in political and activist organisations. Sometimes they are even harder to address because people hesitate to recognise that these problems persist inside progressive groups. This article explores the background of why sexual assault and harassment are happening and what we can do to prevent it.**

> This article was created during “[Pizza & Write-a-thon](/writeathon)” a joint project between Activist Handbook and [Federation of Young European Greens](https://fyeg.org/)

## **Awareness & Prevention Structures in the organisation**

### **Persons responsible**

### **Possible Measures**

## **Awareness & Prevention Structures during Activist Events**

### **Political Camps**

Benefits of tackling this in the context of political camps: The participants of camps for political purposes are together for a longer period of time and are brought together by shared ideas and expectations. This also offers the possibility to tackle the issue of possible sexual assault beforehand and during the event - for example in workshops.

Events like this should anyways also have their own support structure for survivors.
