### **Political Camps**

Benefits of tackling this in the context of political camps: The participants of camps for political purposes are together for a longer period of time and are brought together by shared ideas and expectations. This also offers the possibility to tackle the issue of possible sexual assault beforehand and during the event - for example in workshops.

Events like this should anyways also have their own support structure for survivors.
