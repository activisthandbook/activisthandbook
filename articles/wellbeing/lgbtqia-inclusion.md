**LGBTQIA+ people can face a high level of discrimination in their day-to-day life. If your organization works or engages with LGBTIQIA+ people, we will collect some tips to help you make your community space safer and more inclusive.**

> **Article quality**: ⭐️⭐️ (2/5)

_When we use the term ‘LGBTQIA+’, we are referring to people who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, Questioning, and other gender non-conforming identities. LGBTQIA+ does not cover the full range of sexualities that people identify as, but it is a helpful term for the broader community in the context of this discussion._

## **The problems and solutions for activists in the LGBTQIA+ community**

### **What problems do LGBTQIA+ activists face?**

-   The pressure for ‘’Coming out of the closet’’;
    
-   The lack of using gender-neutral terms in events and communities;
    
-   Violence in protests;
    
-   Assumptions from society about their gender identity or sexuality
    

### **What solutions can we provide to stop the problems from occurring?**

**We shouldn’t put any pressure on ‘’Coming out of the closet’’ for LGBTQIA+ individuals**

The idea that queer politics can be fundamentalist and even problematic should not be surprising, since cohesive, marginalized communities can [reproduce the same exclusionary hierarchies](http://cake.youthkiawaaz.com/2015/10/04/heirarchies-in-lgbt-movement/) they want to escape. In this case, it’s the belief that one has to ‘out’ themselves in order to sincerely participate in queer politics. To be fair, this sense of urgency, this ‘all-or-nothing’ approach is not misguided. Queer erasure is a very real challenge; it should be evident from both mainstream media and our everyday conversations how we assume the ‘default setting’ on everyone we meet is ‘heterosexual-heteroromantic.’ Coming out has always been a strong political tool, but it’s not every queer person’s preferred tool, because for a lot of queer people it can be more damaging, rather than a positive impact.

It’s alright to be forceful about your queer politics, it’s alright to want to create safe spaces that must not be co-opted by the heteropatriarchy. It is sure alright to be unapologetic about your sexual, gender, or romantic identity. But somewhere some concessions ought to be made for those of us who haven’t had the luxury, or the support, or the security of coming out to the world. Even if the ‘presence’ of these persons is marked by a heavy absence from our pride marches and our roundtable conferences, we still need to be able to provide that space.

**Use the right language and ask for pronouns**

Inclusive language can go a long way to making LGBTQIA+ people feel safe and welcome. It’s important to understand that sexual orientation and gender identity/expression are related, but are separate and distinct. Avoid using umbrella terms, such as ‘homosexual’. Instead, opt for precise terminology that encapsulates how that person identifies. If in doubt, ask! LGBTQIA+ people are usually happy to tell you what their preference is and will feel safer and more accepted if you stick to that.

**Pronouns matter: the example of English**

Not all languages have gendered pronouns but, in English, using “he” and “she” requires us to assign a gender to an individual. Last year the Merriam-Webster dictionary added to the definition of the word “they” to explain the word’s use as a singular pronoun, and the use of “they” is increasingly catching on. Many other gender-neutral pronouns can be used; a web search revealed as many as 78 different options. Many LGBT advocates and their supporters, public figures, and people in general, have taken to adding their pronouns in e-mail signatures and social media profiles (for example, US presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Julian Castro, and Bill de Blasio added their pronouns to their official Twitter accounts), and pronoun badges are also becoming popular, e.g. in companies, for staff, and schools and universities, for students.

**Educate yourself and others about anti-LGBTQ violence!**

Pride events are still controversial in a lot of European countries that have been previously clashed with Western-leaning governments over progressive social issues. So it is important that we educate ourselves about the problems in different LGBTQIA+ activist communities both in Europe and around the world. State sanctioned violence is still prominent in a lot of countries around the world.

## Disabled Activists

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1.3 billion people, or 16% of the world's population, have a significant disability. This number is increasing due to population growth, medical advances, and the aging process. ([source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health?utm_source=activisthandbook.org))

-   **Disability is not just a medical condition, but also a social, cultural, and political identity**
    
-   Discrimination against people with disabilities is a violation of human rights. It’s not just an unfortunate fact of life. ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewpulrang/2021/04/22/7-core-arguments-of-disability-rights/?sh=d1acc9954714&utm_source=activisthandbook.org))
    
-   Physical limitation, mental limiation, emotional limiation, and blocked opportunities are not unavoidable consequences of having disabilities. They are products of ableist beliefs about disability, and failure to take steps to ensure equal access and opportunity. We know how to fix or significantly lessen most of the practical problems that make life harder for disabled people. If these problems aren’t fixed or improved, it’s because we have directly or indirectly decided not to.
    

### What you can do for your comrades:

-   Meeting in person? Consider meeting location, parking, stairs, distance from curb to room, types of seating for all sizes and shapes of bodies
    
-   Meeting online? Enable recording, eliminate background noises, provide CART captions, and send out resources ahead of time in either large, simple font, or in a document that can be edited to fit the user's needs
    
-   Most of all: ask questions! Many disabilities are invisible. Many disabilities are acquired with age, and many worsen with age. You may not always see someone with a mobility aid, a sensory tool, a magnifying glass, or other accommodations they have provided themselves to cope with a **life and a world that was not built for them**.
    
-   Be a person who encourages and allows their disabled comrade's energy to go to their advocacy for the cause they believe in, not always having to be the sole advocate for themselves.
    
-   Ask and learn! What do your people need to feel safe and open to contribute and show up fully themselves? Their presence is vital, and we get to our goals together or not at all - so let's make sure our disabled friends feel like they belong.
    

## Neurodivergent Activists

-   Many neurodivergencies fall under disability - so please read above!
    
-   A core theme and motto for the ND and AuDHD (autistic and ADHD) community is "_nothing about us without us_" - which resounds throughout organizing and community building, right?
    
-   Remember that a lot of what you might have learned from TV or TikTok about generalizations and stereotypes may not be true of your new friend. The saying goes, if you've met one autistic person, you've met one autistic person.
    

### What you can do for your comrades:

-   Educate yourself!
    
    -   "You don't look autistic!", "But you seem so focused, I wouldn't have guessed you had ADHD", "You always venmo me the right amount, your dyscalculia can't be _that_ bad!" "Everyone's a little on the spectrum!"
        
    -   These statements increase emotional labor and put the impetus of teaching you on the ND or disabled person, and puts them on the defensive of justifying the validity and severity of their condition.
        
    -   Instead, ask how it affects their day-to-day life. What does a good day look like, and what does it take for them to get there? What do bad days look like, and what kind of support would they like during those times?
        
    -   Anticipate communication and sensory needs.
        
        -   Present information in more than one way. Orally, written, or with a metaphor, image, or story. Be prepared to send a synopsis after each meeting as a follow-up, and letting people know the agenda, attire, and expectations ahead of time is always a bonus. This helps with emotional, mental, and nervous system regulation to keep all cylinders firing.
            
        -   Meeting in person: hold expectations loosely as far as seating, and have low lighting and white noise options available should they become beneficial.
            
-   Ask and learn! What do your people need to feel safe and open to contribute and show up fully themselves? Their presence is vital, and we get to our goals together or not at all - so let's make sure our neurodiverse friends feel like they belong.
