## About this circle

**Summary:** Localisation circle is working on ways to adapt the contents of Activist Handbook to the local contexts of our readers, by translating the articles into various languages and looking for examples of activist practices in local communities. We are also aiming to strengthen local activist communities through the “[Rebel Hubs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLC8OHYbzKo4v4UDkao27Z2NQIy5OBSc_SXs0uLqMBk/edit)” project. We value diversity and inclusivity, we're constantly searching for ways to bridge cultural and language gaps, we organise.
