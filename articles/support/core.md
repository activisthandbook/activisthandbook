## Important: security guide

**As volunteer in the core circle, you get access to sensitive data. It is mandatory that you read our** [**security guide for activists**](/tools/security)**.**

Groups working on social/racial justice, environmental, immigration and refugee issues, as well as gender and reproductive rights are being targeted by hackers/trolls that are intent on subverting their work for political reasons.

You should protect yourself from hackers. As activist, you are in a high risk group. Digital security practices help protect campaigners from malicious online attacks and intrusive surveillance efforts led either by groups that are hostile to your agenda or by repressive government agencies.
