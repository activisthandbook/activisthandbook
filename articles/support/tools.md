**In this article**, **we explain what digital tools our volunteers use frequently. We highly encourage you to ask for help if you have trouble using one of these tools.**

## Tech training

All new volunteers get a tech training to help you get started using our digital tools. Our tech supporter will reach out to you to schedule a video call.

We recommend everyone to follow this tech training, even if you are tech savvy.

> **Did we forget to give you a tech training?** Send us a message: [iason@activisthandbook.org](mailto:iason@activisthandbook.org)

## Google Workplace

Every Activist Handbook volunteer gets their own personal Google Workspace account. With the account, you get access to:

-   Personal email address (name@activisthandbook.org)
    
-   Google apps
    
    -   Gmail: [mail.activisthandbook.org](https://mail.activisthandbook.org/?utm_source=activisthandbook.org)
        
    -   Drive (including 30GB storage): [drive.activisthandbook.org](http://drive.activisthandbook.org)
        
    -   Calendar: [calendar.activisthandbook.org](http://calendar.activisthandbook.org)
        
    -   Meet
        
    -   Groups
        
-   Our passwords
    
-   Useful bookmarks
    

### Step 1: Request access

**Ask a coordinator** to get access to your Google Workspace account.

### Step 2: Sign in to Google Chrome

[**Add a new profile**](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) to Google Chrome and sign in using your Google Workspace account. Your email address is _name@activisthandbook.org_.

### Step 3: Secure your account **⚠️**

Important security steps:

-   As an activist, _you are a_ high-risk _target for hackers._ Take security seriously. Use a randomly generated password and safely store it in a password manager.
    
-   We require all volunteers to [turn on 2-step verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) immediately after creating your account!
    

## Gmail & Google Groups

All volunteers get their own email addresses, which can be accessed via [Gmail](http://mail.activisthandbook.org/?utm_source=activisthandbook.org). For example: [joppe@activisthandbook.org](mailto:joppe@activisthandbook.org)

In addition, all circles have their own email addresses. For example, the finance circle can be contacted via [finance@activisthandbook.org](mailto:finance@activisthandbook.org)

When we receive an email on those addresses, a notification will be sent in the relevant Slack channel. In addition, each circle member will receive the email in their personal Gmail inbox.

In [**Google Groups**](https://groups.google.com/), you can see all the emails for a specific circle. Here, you can also delegate emails to specific people.

## Passwd

In [**Passwd**](https://app.passwd.team/), you can find all passwords that you have been given access to. Sign in with your Google Workspace account.

If you need access to a certain password, ask a coordinator.

## Airtable

We use Airtable to keep track of all our projects & to-dos. Watch these [training videos](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045694613) to learn how to use Airtable.

### Option A: For core circle members

Members of the core circle get access to a pro subscription.

1.  Sign in to [**Passwd**](https://app.passwd.team/) with your Google Workplace account and find the password details for Airtable.
    
2.  [Sign in to Airtably](https://airtable.com/login) with the login details you just copied.
